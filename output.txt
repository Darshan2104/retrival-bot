User_query: "What is Zluri Desktop Agents and how it works?"
LLM:
Zluri Desktop Agents are tools that monitor the usage of SaaS applications on devices and send this data to Zluri servers for analysis. They are compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. 

The desktop agent identifies SaaS applications based on their names and classifies each app launch as an activity. It aggregates daily app activity data for each user and compares it with that of other users in the organization, providing a percentile score for individual app usage.

The data collected by the desktop agent includes device information, installed applications, app launches and exits, background applications, and application running time. This information is accessible through the Zluri dashboard, allowing organizations to evaluate app usage and optimize their SaaS investments effectively.
