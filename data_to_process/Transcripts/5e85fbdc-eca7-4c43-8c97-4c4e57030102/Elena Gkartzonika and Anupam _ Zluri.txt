>>Elena Gkartzonika	00:13
I've sent you a message, but okay. I responded to it Alina, I responded to it and I said thank you. I didn't have the time. No, I can imagine.

>>Anupam Acharya	00:27
I also asked you if you'd want to reschedule this call if you're getting delayed.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	00:31
No, it would be more preferable not to because I will be out of the office next week. And I understand that you have time limitations too, so I wanted to have it concluded today. Thank you.

>>Anupam Acharya	00:49
How are you? I'm very fine Alina, how are you doing?

>>Elena Gkartzonika	00:53
Excellent too, always more happy when it's Friday.

>>Anupam Acharya	00:57
Always a pleasure to meet you, yes, it's always a pleasure to meet you.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:01
That's great. You know how to light up the room. It's not natural.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:11
Thank you.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:12
I will take the credit for the installation.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:15
Absolutely, you should, you should. It's all yours, it's due to you.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:21
So, I have a few questions regarding the final pricing that you have suggested. If you may just provide me with a second to find it. I will just do that.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:38
Yes, I'm just sharing my screen Alina.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:40
That would be even better, thank you.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:42
Yes, yes, I'm sharing my screen so that you are able to see it as well. I hope you can see it now. That's great.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:54
Yes, please.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:55
Please go ahead No, no, no, you wanted to

>>Elena Gkartzonika	01:58
Yeah,

>>Anupam Acharya	01:59
So basically what I was doing was I was explaining how you know, these numbers are arrived and what the explanation behind the numbers was so currently the number of users is for 2 ,000 users, which is you know, 72 ,000 and The additional number of employees since we're already at 622 and most likely we are going to go upwards from here As well So what I have done is I have added 800 users for the upcoming term um, I Kind of lost you for a while.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	02:49
I'm not Yeah,

>>Anupam Acharya	02:50
I'm so sorry

>>Anupam Acharya	03:00
Yes, so coming back to where I was at so basically what we've done is we've You know, I've come up with this number of 800 You know basis our discussions. We can always review that later as well You know once you I'd be happy to hear from you and as contracted which was, you know The three dollars per user per user Per month, which was contracted Basically, what I have done is on that number You I've got the management to work with us And you know We've been able to work with a 40 % discount on that number So that we are able to give you the benefit of adding more users to the platform as well and that number is so for the additional 800 we are giving you the discount of about eleven thousand five hundred dollars and The final number is working out to an additional for the 800 users about seventeen thousand to eighty So the total for this year's renewal The invoice that will be raised anyways since it's a three -year contract, but the invoice needs to be raised so the invoice will be raised for total number of 2 ,800 employees that can be added throughout the year and the total value will be 89 ,000 to 80.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	04:10
This is the rationale behind the proposal that's presented to you That's great because all this presentation clarifies one part of The questions that I was about to ask because it was not that clear to me And I'm happy that we could get on a call thank you for that Thank you, because what it actually was not clear when I was Reviewing the table that you have suggested was whether the additional discount given the fact that it was special discount on additional employees It would be Yeah, I hope that's clear right now, yes The total led to that way, but I was not sure if we were to pay that amount now And then we would expect the price to be suggested based on that numbers or not Okay This is one case and this is where we are thinking that we will be at. Thank you for having that all Included.

>>Anupam Acharya	05:16
My pleasure Elina

>>Elena Gkartzonika	05:19
An additional question I had from the team And They they were because we we had the reviewed with the team And I will be honest I didn't have the the opportunity to Say a little bit further. What would be the case if Despite the projections that we have provided we will just go be above I understand so Elina How about you know, let's say that We I can add in another hundred users as part of this if that's okay so that you get that buffer

>>Anupam Acharya	06:04
And it doesn't You know kind of put you off your projections and your budget says well So what we'll do is we give you an immunity for another hundred users, which this number we will from 2800 I will change it to 2900 and you know, does that serve the purpose?

>>Elena Gkartzonika	06:21
That would be even better. Thank you It would provide the buffer to the if it's not inconvenient for your approach An additional buffer for the team to work on and Final this offer will be code terminals to the existing one. It will be for one year ending

>>Anupam Acharya	06:46
When So basically the renewal actually we you know

>>Anupam Acharya	06:53
The team, it had to raise the invoice in July, I believe. But just give me a second. Let me pull up the contract, if that's all right, Elina.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	07:02
No, yes, yes, yes. Great. Because it's something I want to clarify in order to see.

>>Anupam Acharya	07:08
Absolutely, absolutely. And what I would also recommend is that we bring this as an addendum into the contract so that you are able to take the benefit in the next year after this as well. That becomes a benefit for you.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	07:22
And that would be my last question. If, apart from paying the additional cost on which we are aligned, I would suggest, if it is possible for you to have this added in the existing agreement in order to be allowed. Elina, yes.

>>Anupam Acharya	07:40
I'm one step ahead with you on this. I'm making sure that that's going to be there.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	07:44
So please don't worry about it. Ok. So, no need for a con. Let's close the conversation. Let's proceed with our work.

>>Anupam Acharya	07:54
Absolutely.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	07:54
We are very aligned on that, Elina. One of the most fruitful discussions on marketing. Sorry, I didn't hear you then. One of the most fruitful discussions on producting. That fast.

>>Anupam Acharya	08:08
Absolutely, absolutely. No, I mean, the idea is to make it a win -win, Elina. And I know we are here. We are committed for the long run with you all here as well. So it's very important for us to, one second, let me just, I think I pulled up the wrong contract here. But yes, we are keen on ensuring that we work together on this.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	08:34
Because in such a manner, we will have the additional pricing settled. I know it's already there, but you will have a graphic configuration thereof. And then for the additional users, you will have the ability to actually use the buffer and not lose it. And then try to find ways to bring it back in a more efficient manner. Yes, that would be excellent.

>>Anupam Acharya	09:01
Absolutely, Elina. Absolutely. So this is from the 1st of July, Elina. And we can have this effective from the 1st of July 2024. And this can continue for the next term as well until 2026. So we will bring that as an addendum to the contract. Just put this point in there that this is the new number of users. And this is the new pricing. And we'll close on that for this year and the next, if that works for you, Elina.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	09:29
That would be great. And that would honestly conclude everything that I had to discuss. My pleasure. My pleasure, Elina. My pleasure. Thank you for the additional discount, despite being an additional cost. We have a big contract. It has to remain in logical margins. We will change in 2025. It's something that it should not be brought upon when discussing the text. Absolutely. It will be an addendum.

>>Anupam Acharya	10:02
Yes, it will be an addendum. So absolutely, yes.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	10:06
And then it will help a lot integrate the actual contract in our...

>>Anupam Acharya	10:10
Absolutely.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	10:11
In the contracts we consider strategic and not only for their duration. I think that actually starting from next year, we will start seeing the actual benefit of Zlori. And this is where we need to have everything in place.

>>Anupam Acharya	10:29
Absolutely, Elina. And we're aligned with you on this. Even the team is completely committed. Even our leadership is. And that's why these numbers are coming from top down, Elina. It's not my decision. And it's a decision that's taken at a leadership level at Zlori as well. So we are all committed to make this work. And we're looking at this as a very successful partnership.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	10:49
That's great.

>>Anupam Acharya	10:50
That's important for us as well. We want you to succeed. And Elina, I just had one request. Since this, the invoice was to be raised in July. And by the time I came in, it was a little later than that. Just wanted to check is it okay if we can have the invoice raised for the month on the last date of the September, because it goes into the July, August, September quarter.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	11:17
Yeah, it will not be such a big difficulty and such a big problem if we keep it in these days, in the running days. So we will send the latest on Monday. If you have it ready, send it over today. We can consider it sent in the first 10 days. It usually doesn't work today, but you always have the ways to - Absolutely.

>>Anupam Acharya	11:38
I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. What I'll do is I'll try and have the team because I'll get the team to raise the invoice with the numbers. If you could just give me a sign off on the email saying that instead of 2 ,800 users, we'll have -

>>Anupam Acharya	11:52
It for 2900 users at this price and this will be a requirement for this year as well as the same numbers continue for the next year.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:00
So I will send it over as a confirmation and a follow -up of our discussion.

>>Anupam Acharya	12:05
Absolutely.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:05
And then you can reply on that. Great.

>>Anupam Acharya	12:08
Absolutely, that would be very kind Alina. So if you can help me with that in the meantime I'll get the finance team to have the invoice so that you can have it processed before you leave for the weekend.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:16
More than happy to. My pleasure Alina.

>>Anupam Acharya	12:19
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time and thank you so much for taking time out and you know closing in on this.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:26
Thank you very much for all the help always provided by the whole team and especially from you. You are a new entry to the team and it's been very efficient ever since the beginning so it's really important to have it mentioned.

>>Anupam Acharya	12:40
My pleasure.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:41
Thank you. I will have it concluded and sent. It will be the first thing that I will do when I go back to my desk before because in any other way I will forget it and it will.

>>Anupam Acharya	12:52
I will send you a reminder Alina if you forget it.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	12:57
I don't want to have things forgotten. Okay.

>>Anupam Acharya	13:01
Absolutely.

>>Elena Gkartzonika	13:02
Have a very nice weekend ahead. The rest of the day.

>>Anupam Acharya	13:06
