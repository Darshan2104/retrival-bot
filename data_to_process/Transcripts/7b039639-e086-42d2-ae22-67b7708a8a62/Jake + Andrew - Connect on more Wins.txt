>>Jake Tessier	00:00
Hey, Andrew, what's going on, man?

>>Andrew Post	00:02
What's up, Jake?

>>Jake Tessier	00:05
How's your Friday going?

>>Andrew Post	00:07
Oh, it's busy. Yeah. Working back since 8.

>>Jake Tessier	00:14
That was my yesterday. I started at 8, finished at 5, meetings nonstop, and luckily today is a little bit easier, a little more friendly, at least. So I just wanted to connect with you with the busy day you've got. I don't want to take a lot of your time. I just want to see, you know, we got Forge, which was great. You introduced them. I kind of took it from there and ran to the trial, and then we signed them. So that worked out well. Good win. Congrats to you, to me, I guess. But I want to see if there's anything else that comes to mind. Any, you know, any other potential clients that could use a Saas management platform or user access reviews or, you know, automation of onboarding and offboarding that you think might be able to be another potential win?

>>Andrew Post	01:08
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of them, right? Like, I mean, pretty much every customer should be a target, right? I mean, who doesn't need a platform like this? That's what we think as well.

>>Jake Tessier	01:26
Just a matter of if they prioritize it or if there's other projects that they have going on, big projects or lack of budget that might limit the potential to get it. But I don't know. What do you think? Would you want me to, like, send you a kind of template email that you could share? Do you want me to, you know, hop on a call? What does it look like to you? Because I know it's your, I mean, it's your client base. So obviously, it's your decision.

>>Andrew Post	01:58
So what do you, I guess a better question is, what do you cover?

>>Jake Tessier	02:00
Yeah, so I cover West.

>>Jake Tessier	02:05
Which would be kind of the line down from, wish I knew my map of the US a little bit better, like Idaho, down Utah, Arizona, and then west of that, except Utah is not mine. So it's really like Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and then like Alaska, Hawaii, but you know.

>>Andrew Post	02:39
And all companies in between.

>>Jake Tessier	02:44
Yes, I'm technically in commercial segments. So for us, that's 250 to 1 ,500. Our enterprise rep for The West Coast is on her way out. We're looking to fill that in. So if there's any bigger than 1 ,500 that have a big use case or need for slurry, until we fill that, would likely filter to me as well. But my sweet spot is like the 250 to 1 ,500 range. And if you have any that are outside of my range, I'm obviously happy to introduce you to any of my colleagues that work those areas. But me specifically, that's where I'm at.

>>Andrew Post	03:24
Yeah, I'm just thinking about a lot of my customers are in that kind of 250 to 1 ,500 range, and I've got some that kind of go up to like that 2 ,500 or more, but a lot of my customers are. So I actually just got a Slack from Dave. He's wondering about the Msa.

>>Jake Tessier	03:44
Yes.

>>Andrew Post	03:45
Does he need to sign that or?

>>Jake Tessier	03:47
That's what the team is telling me because I know your order form. He said signing that form executes the Msa, but then I shared that form with my legal team and they were like, it doesn't really actually call out to the Msa. We went back and forth on the Msa. He said it looked good. They did their red lines. They said, this is fine. So I didn't see it as much of an issue, but I don't know. That's something that the team is like, we need to get that signed by somebody as a, I don't wanna say a formality, but a protection essentially, just because of what's in the terms and conditions of that.

>>Andrew Post	04:37
Yeah, I'm just telling them.

>>Jake Tessier	04:38
Okay.

>>Andrew Post	04:40
So yeah, he's gonna respond.

>>Jake Tessier	05:14
And do you work just The West Coast as well? West Area or are you all over?

>>Andrew Post	05:31
So I would say yes. I would say the majority of my accounts, they have one that is in Iowa, Olm Foods, but everything else is like, Colorado, California. I'm pretty sure that's, yeah, pretty much all of them would fall into your West Coast range.

>>Jake Tessier	06:05
Yeah.

>>Jake Tessier	06:15
I know you're waiting to see if Dave responds, but.

>>Andrew Post	06:20
He just said he'll send one over now.

>>Jake Tessier	06:23
Okay, awesome. Sounds good. So in terms of actionable items, moving forward here, do you, what do you need from me? Like, do you need materials or resources? Do you wanna put feelers out to a couple and see if you get any reception? What do you see? Yeah, give me like something that I can use to reach out, right?

>>Andrew Post	06:52
And give them kind of a blurb of your elevator pitch, right? That see if I can get some guys or customers that are interested in.

>>Jake Tessier	07:04
Gotcha.

>>Jake Tessier	07:04
Setting up discussions is that good in like email format just kind of the blurb in an email or do you want actual like pdf one -pager resource or both case studies like when you're pitching it to your customers like what does that look like is it you get on meetings with them once a week or every couple weeks And you might just show them like some slides kind of different

>>Andrew Post	07:29
Right

>>Jake Tessier	07:29
It's different between all of the all of my customers some of them i have weekly meetings with some of them i have bi -weekly meetings with some of them i just meet as we have projects that come up so it varies so i would think that you know just send me over whatever materials you have i'll throw it in a folder on my side and then be able to kind of pull what uh what i need based on who i'm reaching out to or what my opportunity of having that discussion is sounds good only other thing i'll send that over today at some point and then do you want to just leave it you know and then reach out to me when you start to get some you know interest or do you want to sync up in like two weeks and chat about how things are coming any sort of cadence or just i'll go ahead you know as you you'll go ahead drop it to people And then you'll just let me know if anyone is interested yeah

>>Andrew Post	08:39
I mean i think i think the way it typically works best is to you know grab like a list of targets right And we both work on a list of targets that we're trying to get into right and that might be you know three or four of my customers and three or four targets that you're trying to get into right And we're both you know kind of trying to work to that you know initial introduction meeting right and kick off a project that's usually how i see it

>>Jake Tessier	09:16
And then you know it's like it's like hey you know i'm going to follow up with my customers you're following up with you know your targets that we're trying to get into

>>Andrew Post	09:22
And it's it's a partnership Right so you know value for me is you're going to help get me into that other account that's on to today that's a target of mine value for you Is we're going to get some You know pipeline built out and i'm going to get you hopefully into some of the accounts that i'm already selling to Right

>>Jake Tessier	09:40
Okay Sure that list you know the list you're trying to get into um do you want to share that with me or give me a few names that i can start working those uh targets as well do you want to see the ones that i'm currently working and see if we align on any of them

>>Andrew Post	09:57
Yeah that might be a good idea you know there may be some that are already like low -hanging fruit that you know are already existing customers of mine that we can maybe fast track some of the things that you're that you're trying to do right sure um when you guys fix that uh the way the partnership agreement we end up sending it over you know kind of correctly

>>Jake Tessier	10:21
I'm pretty sure we charged you at the 31 000 so it was sent over that way which makes no sense when i'm told to do it the opposite And then when they actually do it It's uh it's in progress it's not the top priority for our new vp global sales But it is he's focusing more on channel this quarter that's one of his priorities um so hopefully soon

>>Andrew Post	10:47
Um so they did so you guys ended up invoicing us only the 31 000 instead of the 39 39

>>Jake Tessier	10:55
Yeah Yeah Which it's like why are you telling me to do it one way and then like why are we doing it the way that frankly makes more sense Anyway i i don't know that's funny It's it's Yeah it's all new You know the partner angle here for the folks that we had the guy that we hired has been working channel for a while as part of his kind of initiative so he knows a lot more about it And he's the one that's going to be fixing it up um But yeah as of now that's how it's uh that's how it's set up now if i'm working i have a you question if i'm working an account And i want to bring you guys in like what is my value prop for saying you should go with converge and purchase us through converge because you'll get a better price like how would you suggest i position it So that an account that i'm working that you're trying to get into or that i want to give you an introduction to like that i can use a value prop

>>Jake Tessier	12:03
For going through you guys versus just direct?

>>Andrew Post	12:09
Yeah, I mean, you know, part of it is understanding the customer, right? And what's valuable to them and what we can, what we provide as a channel partner. Let me show you something. Let me pull something up real quick and I'll show you kind of, because you probably haven't seen the story of Converge.

>>Jake Tessier	12:26
I have not.

>>Andrew Post	12:29
Let's see if I've got the, here.

>>Andrew Post	12:47
So we do a lot, right? Just so you kind of are aware of what we do do. Let's see here, there. Can you see my screen?

>>Jake Tessier	13:03
It is, yep, it's up now.

>>Andrew Post	13:08
So this is kind of like, I think of this as like kind of our first call deck, right? We go through kind of, you know, our core values, who we are as a company, right? Yeah, these are usually kind of marketing slides, right? The things that we do. This is a cool slide because it shows kind of the breadth of Converge, right? We're a publicly traded company. I think we're 5 billion annual in sales, if not more, right? And so continually growing. So lots of offices all across The United States. We have managed services. We're in Hawaii, Mexico, Europe, Canada and growing, right? But something that usually resonates with customers, we have 1500 global technical resources. I think that's actually more like 2000. Lots of pre -sales solution architects. But then these are like post -sales implementation type resources, right? That are focused on, you know, different aspects of IT.

>>Jake Tessier	14:16
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	14:17
Lots of customers, pretty big behemoth of a company, right? This is the way that we kind of built out. So this kind of goes along with like when we're telling the story about Converge. Converge was built up of a bunch of acquisitions and really what the founder of Converge wanted to do was acquire companies in, you know, call it Nfl football cities. Because that's kind of like, you know, where you have a mass density of companies and corporations, right? And so he bought smaller regional bars that were call it in the 50 to $150 million a year kind of range, but that had, you know, really good customers, but also key skills, right? And things that they focused on. So I'll give you an example like Blue Chip Tech. You can see this guy right here in 2018. That's where I came from, right? And our kind of core competencies with Blue Chip Tech was, yeah, you know, we did all the basic stuff, but we were really focused on building out big networks. Right, so we were really good on, you know, helping people build out, you know, routers and top of rack switches and, you know, building out, you know, high performance networks.

>>Jake Tessier	15:48
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	15:48
Basically the stuff that runs the internet, right? Like Google, Dropbox, you know, Facebook, all these companies that have these massive online presences, right?

>>Jake Tessier	16:03
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	16:04
So that was kind of our, one of our core competencies. The other one was cloud, right? So we were really good helping people build out and do like Finops on AWS and things like that. Whereas if you look at someone like KeyInfo, KeyInfo that was purchased that year also was really their core competencies were around security. Right, and so they acquired these companies that then, you know, helped fill out these, we call them practices, right? That we'd kind of identified as core competencies or practices in the IT industry of the services that are offered through the, you know, traditional bar space, right? So some of our companies that we bought, you know, did more of the application space, right? This advanced analytics and app modernization.

>>Andrew Post	17:02
And artificial intelligence, right? That's where their engineering resources were really focused because that was their superpower, right? There's numerous companies that we bought that had engineering resources in those practices, right? So then we basically, what we do is we take those engineering resources that are really good at that instead of making them jack of all trades where they also have to talk about like building out a Dell server or talking about cybersecurity or things that wasn't really their superpower. We basically took them and said, hey, this is your superpower. You are now gonna be a part of a practice or a company within the company that focuses on your superpower. So we're gonna let you go be super, right? Instead of mediocre at talking about network because network's not really your thing. Your thing is talking about artificial intelligence and the cool things that you can do with it and being a data scientist. And that's where your passion is. That's what you're super good at. That's what we're gonna have you focus on and stick with, right?

>>Jake Tessier	18:11
Yeah, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	18:12
So we built all these different practices with all of these different acquisitions of what we did and we hired in addition. But basically each one of these practices is kind of like its own business within Converge, right? And so then I have, you have someone like me, right? Who is a senior account manager been doing this for 20 plus years, right?

>>Jake Tessier	18:35
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	18:36
I know, and I might even be kind of the unicorn, right? Cause I understand actually pretty much all of these different practices, but a lot of our account managers might have always only been selling cybersecurity, right? And they're trying to understand cloud or they're trying to understand DI or app modernization or artificial intelligence, right? And they just don't really know a lot about it. I kind of know a good amount about each one of them, but we have, call it overlay sales reps. We call them solution specialists that belong to each one of these different practices, right? So whenever I have a project or an opportunity, then I bring in, you know, let's say it's a, let's say it's within, I would call your product in our digital workplace environment, right? Is where you guys would kind of land, right? So let's say it's a Dw project. We want to talk to the Lurie. I would bring in Eric Tout is my digital workplace solution specialist. It's his job to be, you know, a solution specialist or, you know, to know everything about digital workplace, right? And our offerings around it and the different products that are in that market. So one of the things that I would suggest for you guys in particular is starting to, like if you guys are trying to build out your channel program, one of the things that you want to do is start getting ingrained with the guys that are actually going to be the ones recommending your solution to customers, right? So like somebody might come to me and say, hey, I'm looking to, you know, be able to wrap my arms around all of our, you know, subscriptions, all of our, you know, licensing, all the things that you guys solve for.

>>Andrew Post	20:27
But we don't really even know that you guys exist because you're not working or, you know, I do, but like Eric Tout is one of seven solution specialists that cover The United States, right? So if you guys were marketing and educating, winning the hearts and minds of the digital workplace team are, you know, 700 sales reps that are putting in resource requests for digital workplace, when they get engaged in those kinds of conversations, instead of introducing a, call it competitor to what you guys do, or try to come up with a different solution to solve something that you guys solve. See what I'm saying? Like, if you can win the hearts and minds of those people, then that's going to be the way that you guys kind of get breadth across the whole Converge, you know, 4 ,000 plus customers, right?

>>Jake Tessier	21:30
Yeah, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	21:32
But anyways, back to the story, right, is we have these solution specialists for each one of these different practices. Within each one of these different practices, we provide these service offerings, right? So we can advise customers on helping to architect, design the solutions to their projects and what they're trying to solve. We can help them implement whatever projects those are. So pretty much everything that we sell within each one of these different practices, we have professional.

>>Andrew Post	22:01
Professional services resources to be able to do the installation or the implementation, the configuration, all of that stuff. We provide that, so we help make sure that it gets set up the way that they need it to be set up. In addition to that, we can also, again, call it 95 percent of those products, we can provide managed services around. We have a massive managed services offering where we do a service desk, we do pretty much everything. Security operations, we have Knox, we have full -blown managed services, and we can manage just single environments and things that you're bringing up, and we can manage whole environments. We can literally do outsourcing of your different, maybe your security team. We can outsource your security, we'll give you a virtual Ciso, we can provide you a SOC, we can have SOC analysts that are analyzing all of your incidents as they happen. We can leverage your tools or even provide the tools to provide your cybersecurity defense.

>>Jake Tessier	23:11
Got you.

>>Andrew Post	23:15
I've spoke a lot, but that's why I said it depends on the customer. When you're having a conversation with this, to some of them, it's not going to matter. To some of them, you're going to be like, Oh s***, wow, okay, this is really cool that it's great that we're doing this, but we didn't even graze into any of these things. But I'm having issues with my Microsoft licensing and I can't figure out how to license it properly. Do you guys do that? Yes, 100 percent. I have a whole team dedicated just to Microsoft, and they're 85 people, that's all they do. I have a Microsoft licensing expert that actually will come in and help you dissect what your licensing is today, and how you can save money or license it properly so that you're not overspending on your Microsoft contract. Then we put that contract, we provide what's called a Csp around your Microsoft contract, and then that includes a customer success manager, it includes a set of engineers in the back -end that as you have issues, we are the frontline of support, we are your first call of support that you make. Typically, we're able to help resolve your issues without having to go to Microsoft support, and if you've ever worked with Microsoft support, it's a nightmare, which is why that's such a huge value.

>>Jake Tessier	24:40
Yeah, sure.

>>Andrew Post	24:42
Those are the kinds of things that we talk about and can do. From your standpoint, like having a conversation and somebody is like, well, I don't want to bring in Converge, and it's almost like, well, Converge is A, a great partner of ours and one of our go -to partners. They're fantastic, they're quick, they're responsive. They're going to give you great pricing, so you're going to get better pricing from them, and then you're going to be able to get direct. But they also have a lot more capabilities, so it probably makes sense to have a conversation with them about the other things they can do that may help you guys across the board.

>>Jake Tessier	25:18
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	25:19
That's whenever we come in, we have this conversation delivered in a bit of a different way to a customer that helps them understand the value that we drive across the board. Whether or not they want to use any of this, we still have the ability to give them preferential pricing, better pricing than they would be able to get direct. We're pretty much, for most of our partners, we're top -level partners on pretty much everything, so typically, we're saving them money. So regardless, if they're like, oh, we already know exactly what I want, here's my config, this is what I want to buy. Send it to me and I can typically get it to you for five, 10 percent less than what your quote already was. Got you. We can save you money, but we can also provide all these additional services around it. A great example would be like, hey, I want to implement Crowdstrike. Okay, great. Crowdstrike's quote to install and configure theirs was $100 ,000. I can create an SOW and a cost for them and typically, mine's going to come in at 70 percent of whatever that Crowdstrike cost was. The funny thing is we provide a much better experience for the customer because we're not Crowdstrike. So it's not, okay, well, it's going to be eight weeks until we can set up a kickoff call And it's going to be like it's not like this huge elongated process with somebody who has no idea what they're doing And they're basically just reading out of a script.

>>Andrew Post	27:00
We actually come in, understand exactly what you're trying to do because we just sold you the CrowdStrike software, had all these conversations and then everything runs smoother. You buy it, two weeks later, we're having a kickoff call, we're going through implementing it, getting everything set up. So your time to value or your time to actually having this product in -house and working is typically a lot less also. So I mean, there's a lot of values of what we drive, but how do you just throw that up on a customer when they say, well, why do I want to work with Converge? Well, there's a lot of reasons, but you know, let's figure out what's important to you.

>>Jake Tessier	27:37
Right. Sure. Yeah. It makes sense. Now that's a good insight into what you guys do and how you do it and why customers work with you.

>>Andrew Post	27:47
Yeah. Yeah. So that would be the way that I would do it. For you, I would normally focus on like, you know, I would focus more on the, hey, they are one of our go -to partners, you know, we're building out our channel strategy. And so, you know, they are a go -to partner. They're going to be able to give you the best pricing. So first off, that would be, you know, should be enough reason in itself.

>>Jake Tessier	28:12
Sure.

>>Andrew Post	28:12
Second off, they have a lot of capabilities and they do a lot of things outside of Zlury. So it would be great to have a conversation with them about how they may be able to help support your journey as a company. Right. I mean, it's not even just like IT, it's finance, it's operations, it's, you know, it's everything.

>>Jake Tessier	28:34
Yeah. Makes sense. Cool, man. Well, that helps. I'll send you the resources your way from us as well, so you have them. And then do you want to, like, account list, you want to exchange account list or target account list, or do you want me to send you mine and you can let me know if any overlap or what do you want to do there?

>>Andrew Post	28:58
Yeah, I mean, I would love to, like, look through an account list. I think that's sometimes the easiest, right, is just finding a, call it the low -hanging fruit, right? I have a bunch of accounts. I'll just kind of run through these real quick. You tell me if any of them jump out at you. So there's a company called Capslaw, Community Action Partnership with San Luis Obispo. They're pretty big, kind of a nonprofit. Velocity Global is another account of mine. Somebody I was actually thinking about for you, there's about a thousand users, do a lot of stuff with them. Dropbox is going to be above you, so it's like 3 ,500 users. St. Joseph's Church is probably too small, it's not going to be interesting. Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital, I don't know how many employees they have, but that could be interesting. They're actually really focused on trying to save money and reduce costs. Flexport, maybe too big, I don't know how many employees they have, they may have like 2 ,000. Gilroy Gardens is probably going to be too small, I would think, but could be interesting. Menlo Security, there are like 400 employees, so they're probably good for you.

>>Jake Tessier	30:27
I've talked with Menlo Security, actually. That's a good one. We were talking last fall slash winter, and they were looking at us, and they had a new CFL, and the Cfl was like, we're not paying more than, I think it was like a thousand a year for you guys, or something like crazy like that, which is just like not feasible, so we ended up dropping it. But I have had contacts with Menlo and their team, so that's an interesting overlap there.

>>Andrew Post	31:02
So maybe grab that one, right, because that could be one that I can help have more conversations with, and try and spark some things up. Specialized Bikes is another one, they are going to be too big, they're like 3 ,000 employees.

>>Jake Tessier	31:19
Who did you work with, sorry, just at Menlo, was it Ed Millen, is that the guy?

>>Andrew Post	31:26
Yeah.

>>Jake Tessier	31:27
And Kasia, who's gone for now. Okay.

>>Andrew Post	31:31
Yeah, Ed's the director of IT there, I work with him on a real, I've actually got a Slack channel with him, I talk to him all the time.

>>Jake Tessier	31:38
Okay, cool.

>>Andrew Post	31:40
And then his whole team, Anthony Russo, Juan Jung, those guys.

>>Jake Tessier	31:45
Yeah, okay.

>>Andrew Post	31:48
Specialized Bikes is too big, so Yeah, I would just create like an Excel document, right, and let's start kind of trying to put those targets together, but I would say put Menlo on there, and we can circle the wagons on that one.

>>Jake Tessier	31:58
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	31:59
Utility Trailer Sales of California. They could be interesting. Their owner is all about saving money. They're definitely gonna be on the sub -thousand employees. Let's see, Agriculture Capital is not, I don't really have any good relationships there. I just inherited that account. San Francisco Unified School District is gonna be too big for you. Docusign is not mine. Forge Global, we just did. Optiv, they may be too big. I don't know how big Optiv is, but they may be large.

>>Jake Tessier	32:39
We just signed on Arctic Wolf, if you're familiar with them, another security, managed security offering, similar to how Optiv kind of runs partnerships in the security world as well as, you know, they do more than that. So that could be a good kind of like in there maybe.

>>Andrew Post	32:58
Yeah, we're Optiv on there. I've got a great relationship with the VP of IT and actually the call that I was on before this, when I was running late for was with Optiv.

>>Jake Tessier	33:06
So. Oh, nice.

>>Andrew Post	33:08
We're doing some big like cloud migration project for them. Cordoval Golf Club, small, probably tough to show the value there. Mckelvin Engineering, they probably need to grow a little bit before it becomes interesting. Profluent Bio, same situation. Logic Monitor, could be interesting. I don't know how big they are though. I'll throw a Logic Monitor on in there. What about Gusto?

>>Jake Tessier	33:42
Gusto is actually what we use as our HR system, but I don't have any, I haven't had any conversations with them.

>>Andrew Post	33:49
I know Gusto side now. Well, I know a lot of their employees. That could be it. That would be a good, yeah. And we use them. So whenever you use the tool that you're talking with, it always helps. A little quid pro quo, you know?

>>Jake Tessier	34:03
Yeah, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	34:06
And I think they would be under 1500 employees. I'm not sure though.

>>Jake Tessier	34:10
Okay.

>>Andrew Post	34:12
Informian, also known as People Finders.

>>Jake Tessier	34:16
Sounds familiar, but I don't think I've talked.

>>Andrew Post	34:20
I could talk to, so I know the director of IT there, good buddy of mine. Throw them on the list though. It might be interesting. I can at least follow up. That's not mine. Cooley Llp, that is mine. So Cooley Law Firm. Roger, familiar with them? Palo Alto?

>>Jake Tessier	34:41
Does that ring a bell?

>>Andrew Post	34:43
Pretty big. So I don't know if they would be too big, but Edge Autonomy is a new one that I'm working with right now. Bren Brown and Caldwell.

>>Jake Tessier	34:59
Another law firm.

>>Andrew Post	35:01
Another law firm, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	35:09
Olm Foods, we talked about. I think they're outside. Ridgeline Apps. Sitecore, Zapier, and Talkdesk. Let me see. Hold on, I think I'm looking at my account site. Yeah, that's more what we want. Let's see here.

>>Andrew Post	35:40
There, actually, let me just share this for you. It might be easier to read while we're talking.

>>Andrew Post	35:53
Can you see my account, my list?

>>Jake Tessier	35:54
Yeah, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	35:57
So Megan's Organic Market, that's an account that I inherited. Eri is another account that I inherited. I wouldn't really focus on either one of those because I don't have any of these ones that you see, like one, two, one, one, two, one, like smaller, you know, like these outside of this one. Like Utility Trailers, I have a relationship with this guy, but I did inherit this account. But like these ones all above. I don't think are worth going after. You got that? Yeah, what's The Glyptic Biotech?

>>Jake Tessier	36:31
I've closed a couple biotechs in The Bay Area, so I don't know if you're trying to break more into that one, but that might be a good one for me to focus on as well.

>>Andrew Post	36:41
This is one that I inherited. I don't really know anything about these guys. Let me see here. Looks like we spelt their name wrong. Not Glyptic.

>>Jake Tessier	36:51
Glyptic. Yeah, Glyptic. Looks like it's actually, I mean, Zoom Info says less than 25 employees.

>>Jake Tessier	36:59
less than five million revenue. So they might be a little small actually for us right now.

>>Andrew Post	37:05
Yeah, it looks like it was Parker Trahan's account. He closed two opportunities with them. So they're probably for Cauda deals, but I don't have information on it, guys.

>>Jake Tessier	37:13
Yeah, nevermind.

>>Andrew Post	37:14
I don't think we have contacts in there. Yeah, so I would, I mean, it would be just like, you know.

>>Jake Tessier	37:21
Yeah, not a great one.

>>Andrew Post	37:27
Chartboost, Roblox, could be interesting. I know like they're, one of their VPs of procurement.

>>Jake Tessier	37:35
At Roblox?

>>Andrew Post	37:36
Yeah.

>>Jake Tessier	37:37
I think we might be having, I'm not personally having the conversation, but I feel like I've seen them come up a little bit.

>>Andrew Post	37:45
They're probably too big for you.

>>Jake Tessier	37:47
Yeah, they're a little bigger, but.

>>Andrew Post	37:50
Specializing would be too big, Dropbox would be too big, San Francisco Unified School District's too big, Menlo Security, I think we already talked about, the metrics being don't waste your time on. Cloudflare, we're actually working with right now.

>>Jake Tessier	38:03
Our CISO knows their Ciso really well, and we had a meeting this week. I don't know if you work with, that's an existing one, Cloudflare, that you've been working or that you've had for a while.

>>Andrew Post	38:17
Yeah, they're an interesting one. So I did a bunch of physical security work for those guys, where we did help them like install their cameras. We did a bunch of structured cabling. We did access control for a bunch of their offices and buildings. We did a bunch of support stuff for them. We did some international work for them, like out in some of the other cities that they're in. We've never really broken into their IT side of the house. So I would love to break into their IT side of the house. We are set up with them. We can transact business with them. And I have never really been able to have the conversations around like what I just kind of walked you through, right? What you add is for everything that they do.

>>Jake Tessier	38:54
They're also kind of a real pain in the ass customer that like doesn't like to pay their bills.

>>Andrew Post	39:02
They don't like, it's just, I'll be honest with you on the structured cabling side, I fired them.

>>Jake Tessier	39:08
Wow.

>>Andrew Post	39:10
Because like they would sign, they would send us POs, sign orders, and then they would go back after when we were trying to collect on them because they were 90, 120 days overdue. They would come back and start asking for discounts and trying to reduce their payments at that point. Right? And it's like, what are you talking about? Like, no, there's like, there's nothing that you can do, right? Like this is what you owe. So do I have to take you to court? Pay your bill. So yeah, they became like a real pain in the ass customer. And so I basically, I had to tell them like, dude, I actually had to give away free services to get them to finish, to get them to pay. Like, and they still, oh, there's still like two outstanding invoices that they still haven't paid that are now like 300 days overdue.

>>Jake Tessier	40:04
So is that maybe like, cause if we're looking to replace Zylo, it's one of our competitors that they use right now and they love us so far at least. Played golf with the guy as well at a partner event and so like mentioning Converge is that you said you haven't really broken into their IT side of the house. So they may not have a lot of intel on it, but like, would that be like a touchy subject or, you know?

>>Andrew Post	40:33
No, I don't think so. I mean, unless you're talking to the head of facilities. No, no. Okay, cool. And it's not even really a touchy subject on their side, right? It's more like on our side.

>>Jake Tessier	40:45
On your guys' side, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	40:46
My management basically came back and said, you're not allowed to accept POs from these people. They're not available anymore because they don't pay their bills, right?

>>Jake Tessier	40:52
Geez, okay.

>>Andrew Post	40:55
Gusto, we talked about. William Morgan Group, I wouldn't worry about. Flexport, I don't know if we talked about them. They may be bigger than you guys though. They're bigger than your group. Informian, we talked about. Hazel Hawkins, we talked about. Alchemy could be a good one. They're going to be in your range. Throw Alchemy on there, that could be interesting.

>>Jake Tessier	41:14
All right.

>>Andrew Post	41:16
Olm Food, we talked about. Mission Bell, don't worry about. Capslow, Velocity Global, I said to throw on there. St. Charles Health is going to be above your size. Forge Global, we just closed. Ontra, don't worry about. Mckelman, don't worry about. Dfinity, don't worry about. Ea's too big. Brown and Caldwell could be possible, but they're, as you can see, just a prospect. Cortomol is just a prospect. Logic Monitor is a prospect. Optiv, we talked about. They're actually not a prospect. We haven't closed one, any opportunity, just because I'm waiting on them signing some stupid legal document that has been stuck with their.

>>Andrew Post	41:57
Our legal team forever, but super strong relationship there. We'll continue to close business. That is my meeting. Yeah, go ahead. Why would I care if you have a panda? Go. Day off for my kids. Today and tomorrow, or today and Monday.

>>Jake Tessier	42:17
Wow, fun.

>>Andrew Post	42:20
Edovics is one that I've been trying to break into.

>>Jake Tessier	42:22
Okay.

>>Andrew Post	42:23
That's definitely one of my targets. Gilroy Gardens, I'm about to close something with, but they're going to be too small for you. St. Joseph's too small. Semgrep, Semgrep could be interesting, if you guys are doing anything with those guys. Edge Autonomy, I'm working on closing a deal right now with them. Proflow and Bio, wouldn't worry about. Finisar, no. Enretsu, no. Cloudon, no. Dropbox, Divinity, we already talked about. Mavener, no. Okta, too big. Pivotal is no longer a company. Sama, no. Saba, no. Simple Solutions, no. Support, no. Syndicated, no. Velodyne. Velodyne is actually not a company anymore either. They got bought. Vmware got bought. Exactly. I wouldn't waste your time on. Western Union, too big. Cooly, possible.

>>Jake Tessier	43:24
Cooly, Llp.

>>Andrew Post	43:27
GoPuff, talk to us. Feather River, no. Valley Oaks, no. Trey, no. Boku, no. Psycorp, no. Trey County is VMware again. City of San Jose. I'd be open to work with you on City of San Jose. I've got one of my customers left there where they were working before and went to City of San Jose. So that's one that I've been trying to get into. Let's see if anything else is on here that's interesting. Phil's Coffee, I didn't even know that was on there.

>>Jake Tessier	44:00
I had a few of those coffees when I come to The Bay Area. I like Phil's.

>>Andrew Post	44:06
Yeah, that could be an interesting one. They're a pretty big company here. They're starting to get big, but I don't think they're too big. So they're probably under that 1 ,500 employees. None of the rest of this looks remotely interesting. Let's see here. Aquarium of the Bay, no. The W, no. Bigger Capital, no. Firestone Walker Brewing could be interesting. It'd be a good one to go after just because I like beer. And I like some of their beer for sure.

>>Jake Tessier	44:43
I don't know how much value we would have with - I mean, they're a pretty big name.

>>Andrew Post	44:52
So, I mean, like Firestone. Have you ever heard of Mindhaze?

>>Jake Tessier	45:01
I want to say I have. Is that a brewery? Is that a type of beer that they make?

>>Andrew Post	45:05
One of the beers that they sell. I mean, it's like all across, you know, it's every major grocery store. They've got a huge, I mean, they're actually a pretty big company. I think they do, I don't know how much they do, but they're pretty big.

>>Jake Tessier	45:19
Mindhaze. I don't know if we've got Mindhaze here in Utah. In general, as you're probably aware, Utah is kind of messed up with how they do alcohol laws, but keep an eye out for it, for the Mindhaze.

>>Andrew Post	45:36
Yeah, I mean, I would even just like, if you have like tools, I'd pull up Firestone Walker, my company, and look, and be like, look for the revenue, because you may put a million bucks on here, but it's like, that's not accurate.

>>Jake Tessier	45:50
Yeah, 136 on Zoom Info, it looks like. Just pretty good. 136 million? 500 employees, that's pretty good. It's actually a pretty good number for that size.

>>Andrew Post	46:01
Yeah, and I would think that's probably a good target for you, right? They're probably in that space where they're like, dude, we need to, you know, we're getting too many things, we wrap our arms around our licensing and everything else that we have.

>>Jake Tessier	46:14
Yeah, yeah.

>>Andrew Post	46:15
Like a good target, just all around company, because their IT is not going to be very mature. They're not, you know, like, it's almost like perfect target for you.

>>Jake Tessier	46:27
Definitely. Put it on the list.

>>Andrew Post	46:30
Yeah.

>>Jake Tessier	46:31
I can share with you some of what I'm working with now as well. If you want me to share, I'll go ahead and share some and see if any names pop out that you're like, that's one that I could really work with. These are the ones that are kind of my current targets here. A lot of software developments,

>>Jake Tessier	46:57
Some healthcare and biosciences Airtable, Apollo, these are ones that I haven't yet Gotten in with but I'm calling and reaching out to you and etc I can show you some on my actual salesforce of what I'm at least held conversations with You know a lot of these are software developments and software platforms because they have tons of of applications they use Tom's Gaming companies are a big hit with us. We have a lot of gaming companies The nature of how they're set up with studios and needing to do chargebacks and such is a big hit for us pay active So I'm just at it recently is click house next door coho heap been labs But these are like I mentioned these are not ones. I'm currently talking with but ones that I'm Targeting targeting And I don't know why And then the ones that I'm like currently chatting with Like some bigger ones. Like I said once in a while I get the larger than the 1500 in my name Indeed is currently evaluating us. Hopefully that will turn into an RFP situation. I think it will This one's gonna fall off Kong has some good potential right now Cloudflare I talked to you about if we can get in with their IT team I can make a mention to you guys and see if assuming you want their business and their PO since they're registered Would be pretty easy to get you guys in there if you're already registered with them and you do stuff with them in other departments

>>Andrew Post	48:48
It makes things easier, right?

>>Jake Tessier	48:50
Yeah.

>>Andrew Post	48:50
Yeah, then you're not going through the whole onboarding process twice, right? You're not going through, you know onboarding you guys and then onboarding us as well.

>>Jake Tessier	48:57
And yeah, sure The antik has a lot of momentum right now, I think they used to be part of Google and now they're not Their solid size they want to replace jump cloud They have money which has always a good thing. I can keep you up to date on that one. Maybe that'll be the Maybe when I can throw back your way for bringing us in on Forge Palo Alto lifelong medical Drada should be starting a trial with shortly. Here's a law firm that Is looking good. The CIOs approved us at it to the budget now. It's just a matter of showing we can do what we can do Possible foods hopefully soon And then some that are further along at the top there, but yeah, like Cloud flare would be a good one Maybe Niantic could be a good option to bring you in once we get in deeper into the pricing conversations But like you said, you know, it's a partnership. So you you know, I want to get you in as well It shouldn't just be one -sided. So any of these Niantic labs? Mm -hmm Believe that's open Salesforce right now That was spun out of Google Mm -hmm hundred million dollar revenue. Yeah, they have money. They they shared with me how much they're spending on Jump cloud right now and what ballpark we need to be in And it's significantly higher than I was expecting. So They're gonna be a good one.

>>Jake Tessier	50:40
Wow Yeah can make a note for them Niantic labs where we gave ballpark pricing out already So once we they're gonna have a chat with our security team to make sure we're compliant with a lot of things which we are and then likely gonna go into a trial here before the end of the year and Probably try to close by December and implement in January. So as those conversations get further I can I Can drop the the converge story some of these value ads you shared with me, you know top partners better pricing Tremendous amount of value outside of just you know Sas management But all IT and a better customer facing experience and I can share some of this with them And if they're open to it, then I can make an intro if you want to do a pitch there I feel this one feels like a good one. That'll close. So it's early though. It's early. So Make a note for that.

>>Andrew Post	51:40
We tell the Google also So I could be kind of another thing it might be an easy add -on right to add us in if they're a part of Google or it's like Sister Company Google sounds like they were spun out of Google.

>>Jake Tessier	51:52
Mm -hmm. Yeah, exactly spun out of Google is what I

>>Jake Tessier	51:55
I'm aware of as well. Cloudflare, we talked about. Any other ones on here that are like interesting to you or you see and you're like this?

>>Andrew Post	52:06
Santa Cruz bikes could be interesting because Santa Cruz bikes kind of like got spun out of like Specialized Bikes. Some of the developers of Specialized Bikes left and started Santa Cruz and Specialized Bikes is one of my big customers. So and I know a lot about their industry and what they're doing so that could be an easy one.

>>Jake Tessier	52:30
Are they then is Specialized Bikes also part of the conglomerate of like Pond Bikes? The Netherlands company are now separate?

>>Andrew Post	52:39
Specialized Bikes is one of the biggest bike manufacturers in the world, standalone.

>>Jake Tessier	52:46
Standalone because Pond Bikes out of the Netherlands have a bunch of sort of segments as well and the guy was telling me all about their bikes in our first call and how you know the winners of the U .S. tours that they do use Santa Cruz bikes and you know tooting his own horn a little bit. Yeah, any other big ones? I'll put together a Google sheet for us.

>>Andrew Post	53:09
Indeed would be awesome. Company.

>>Jake Tessier	53:14
Yeah, I mean they're huge.

>>Andrew Post	53:15
I might as well sell them because they're... Are they based out of Texas?

>>Jake Tessier	53:23
They may be. I mean I can go. What's it say on their LinkedIn?

>>Andrew Post	53:29
It looks like it's a current...

>>Jake Tessier	53:33
Yeah, it looks like Austin.

>>Andrew Post	53:36
Somebody at our company which she's not. She has no opportunities there so I can pull it.

>>Jake Tessier	53:44
Does that mean that they've used... were there any with Indeed? I don't know exactly how you guys are set up. Does that mean that they've registered you if there's...

>>Andrew Post	53:55
No, it looks like there's no one opportunities so it doesn't look like they've done anything But I do have a bunch of contacts in here. I don't know how good they are but like Chris Graff, Nate Sanders, Chris Creed, Jeff Algo, Charles Valentine, Daniel Wynn. I don't know how like current any of those contacts are but... Let me show you my notes for Indeed.

>>Jake Tessier	54:18
These are our big people for Indeed.

>>Andrew Post	54:22
It doesn't look like they've purchased anything from us So we're probably not in their system.

>>Jake Tessier	54:27
Yeah, it's these names right here are the ones that are relevant to the conversations. None of them overlap.

>>Andrew Post	54:40
No, but it is, I mean...

>>Jake Tessier	54:42
It's a huge company, obviously. So that's Indeed. It's big. If anything comes of it, it's not going to come until next quarter if not the following, I would imagine at least. But it's the start there. We'll see where we get But I'll note that one down as well with Indeed, Niantic, and Santa Cruz Bikes as potentials there and then I've noted yours down and I'll add them to my target accounts just to try to get a conversation with them And then we can strategize if I can learn something there.

>>Andrew Post	55:20
Perfect.

>>Jake Tessier	55:21
Awesome. Anything else you want to talk about today?

>>Andrew Post	55:26
No, I think that's good. Send me over those documents. I can start reaching out to my customers. Send me the target list so I make sure that I'm following up on it And we should probably set something up, I would say like end of October just because we know the next two weeks from here are kind of crazy.

>>Jake Tessier	55:47
We can do, if you're good with Fridays, we can do like the 25th or if you want to just do the following week, we could also do November 1st.

>>Andrew Post	55:59
What about like the 21st?

>>Jake Tessier	56:03
Okay, yeah, the Monday. I put all my internal calls on Monday so it's typically pretty full But I have some time between 9 .30 and 11 .30 Pacific or 1 .30 Pacific afterwards, either way.

>>Andrew Post	56:21
Like a half hour at 9 .30. Let's just touch base on it And then it'll be perfect.

>>Jake Tessier	56:30
Sounds good. I'll should be the invite now for that and we can catch up then.

>>Andrew Post	56:36
All right, sounds good.

>>Jake Tessier	56:38
All right. Thanks, Andrew. Have a good weekend, man. Do you go by Andy or Andrew?

>>Andrew Post	56:41
Andy's fine.

>>Jake Tessier	56:42
Okay. Call me. No, it's already Jake. Okay, cool. All right, Andy. Have a good one, man. See you later.
