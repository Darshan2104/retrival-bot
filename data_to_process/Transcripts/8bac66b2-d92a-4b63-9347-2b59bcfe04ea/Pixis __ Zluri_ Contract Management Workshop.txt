>>Prashanth S	00:00
What's up? How are you doing? I'm doing good. How about you? All good. Planning to come to Bangalore anytime soon? I'm not sure. Sometime in the end of this month or maybe first week of November. Okay.

>>Divya Aphale	00:27
Cool. I will be in Bangalore from 14th till 25th of this month.

>>Prashanth S	00:38
14th of this month and 25th?

>>Divya Aphale	00:41
14th till 25th. Yeah, two weeks.

>>Prashanth S	00:44
Great.

>>Divya Aphale	00:59
Let's wait for a couple of minutes. They'll join shortly.

>>Divya Aphale	01:40
Hello. Hi. Hi, Ganesh. Hi, Praveen. Hi.

>>Ganesh Kumar	01:44
Hi, Divya. How are you doing? Great.

>>Divya Aphale	01:51
I think we can get started. Let me just check if everyone has joined. Okay. No worries. We can get started. So, Praveen, Ganesh, we have Prashant on the call and maybe you've met Prashant before. Sometime during the onboarding phase is when he had conducted a very similar workshop for the PIXIS team earlier. So today's workshop is going to be more like a refresher. Refresher for you guys in terms of understanding how to read the contracts data, subscriptions data on the platform, how to upload a contract and a subscription, what's the difference between the two and the small nuances that are involved. So Prashant is a contracts expert at Zuluri and we have the expert on the call today to conduct this refresher workshop for you. So feel free to ask any questions that you might have. He'll help us with the answers for all of your queries. Sure.

>>Ganesh Kumar	02:55
Yes.

>>Prashanth S	02:57
Thanks for setting the context here. Hi, Praveen. Hi, Ganesh. Good to meet you once again. I think we met I think last year between November or sometime, right? I don't remember. But, yeah, I think we met once.

>>Divya Aphale	03:12
I think it was when Deepa was onboarding you and Ganesh at that time.

>>Prashanth S	03:20
Ok, so OK, so we'll just get started. So the main agenda of this workshop is, like Divya mentioned, there are there are different KPIs that are going to define when it comes to the contract management in Zuluri. So I will just give you before I start my before I start sharing my screen, I'll just give a quick brief of what I'll be covering today. So that, you know, this sets an additional context of what elements that we'll be mainly focusing on to, you know, have this workshop a little more interactive and also ensuring on the other part that, you know, the knowledge is rightly transferred. And so that, you know, as and when it is required, your team can handle it by yourself. So that's the whole objective of this particular workshop. It may not be. It is not that it is going to be just a single workshop, but given that the time and constraints, we can definitely have a follow up session as well in case of any questionnaires or anything that comes up. Yeah, so I'll quickly start. So contract management, basically, Zuluri offers, as you know, it's like, you know, you can have all your contracts, subscriptions and perpetual licenses in a single roof where you will be able to quickly, quickly keep a track of all the accessible documents like the contracts and subscriptions. And, you know, that again constitutes to some of the other milestones, such as having a proper renewal management, which is like, you know, setting the reminders in addition to what we offer from the automated reminders that are currently in place.

>>Prashanth S	04:58
Reminders with regard to the contract end date your payment date and for the setting up of the true ups and everything that are expected for the manually added licenses right So that's that's first thing And the second one is going to be how efficiently we can manage the vendors within one single roof again Right so for example if we have multiple set of contracts we might be we might be purchasing or procuring from multiple set of vendors As well right So that's the practical practicality here so we this platform gives you a better view of you know how many contracts are there under particular vendor and what are the spends that are happening for each of these vendors Right So that's one and the third element is going to be it's again a subset of what we are going to do after the contract upload and after we feed the vendor information such So there comes the licenses so basically the licenses are going to be the actual products and services that we procure when we are signing up when we are signing a contract contractual model or a subscription model so it could be both basically contract can be Multi -year or a single year and the subscription can also be a multi -year Or it's it can be of a quarterly or a monthly basis and when it comes to perpetuals it's going to be just one time payment And it's going to be valid throughout right it doesn't have a an end date at all And it is going to be lifetime valid as such so these are the products and services how we are going to efficiently make use of these licenses are going to be the next thing the next element that I would be talking about and the final step is going to be after we upload a contract and after the licenses are mapped and what next the contract module the contracts module constitute is going to be for the licenses optimization as well as the cost optimization for all of these licenses and the perpetual licenses that we have and the subscriptions and the contracts that we have so this is the whole objective that I have for this particular workshop and let me quickly start sharing my screen just one second

>>Prashanth S	07:21
Okay I have shared my screen let me know if my screen is visible Yes Oh so like I gave you a quick set of overview of what is what so the main thing that as soon as we see from our landing page the first thing that you see is the overview page right So here you would be able to see all the contracts that are basically associated with this particular module you will also be able to see the cost of the contracts that are currently in place you can also define the the financial year range between depending upon the data that we have for each of the the contracts that we have uploaded and it is going to be the total cost of the contracts per month And this is going to be the cost in the October month for especially so this is how it will appear in your platform since I'm using a generic account here which the data might not be a sanitized one But this is just for the testing account and also on the top you see the renewals that are the number of renewals that are up for the current month and it is going to give you the right number and the upcoming contract renewals as well so this is pretty much about the cost that we will be seeing and the cost of the contracts and the rest of the things again it's going to be the same as such which constitutes to the other elements

>>Prashanth S	09:22
But we'll quickly jump into the licenses module in the interest of time and like we discussed the licenses subscription costs the contracts perpetuals and everything is going to be under one roof here under the licenses module and the renewals with a separate section here where we'll be coming up I'll be walking you through how this also can be managed and the vendors So I think we just set the context of licenses management renewals and the vendors so I'll just quickly define what is what in a one liner and what difference does it make between the

>>Prashanth S	09:58
Scopes of the license and the types of the license and There are certain amount which we'll be making use of in terms of the quantities Again, these are qualitative figures The consumed quantity was unassigned and the cost in the total cost in the utilized versus the unutilized as such now that we see there are a lot of licenses that are already coming in and There are two scopes of licenses, which I would always be Referring to so the first one is going to be the Autofetch licenses, which has this green Icon next to it the green indicator next to it are defined as Autofetch licenses in slurry So these are something which is fetched from the direct integration through the API So when we are connecting an application through slurries integration So basically what we get for example, if we are connecting Google workspace I'm sure we'd be selecting multiple scopes in that there are different read and write scopes when it comes to the application integration So I think by default Google workspace slack Zoom And major duty and as such many applications, right? So it constitutes with the it comes up with the Autofetch licenses scope within itself from the direct integration So, how do we differentiate that is the the licenses that you see with the green indicator are referred to as Autofetch licenses so we need not have to create a license manually in this case because The platform is fetching the license information from the application directly So depending upon the relevance of these licenses and what we have from the invoices, we can definitely go ahead and map those Contracts to this particular license is basically so it's the first use case is something which I'll show you how an Autofetch licenses is available and you're going to map a contract against it, right?

>>Prashanth S	11:55
So let's take an example of confluence here or let's take a single application, which is Okay, let's take an example of G2 crowd which has an Autofetch licenses by itself all we have to do is we'll just have to click on add to sub subscription or contract And We'll just have to select the right entity whether this is a subscription contract or perpetual So for now since we are doing a workshop, I'm selecting the expansive one, which is the contract I'll just select this And we can ensure that the G2 crowd license is already selected So if you see the X mark here, this is this means this denotes that it is already selected But when it is not selected, you can always come back here Just click on this Plus and this means that this is selected we already have the quantity as 5000 Depending upon the quantity that we have in our invoice. We can go go back and edit that as well so since this is coming in from the direct integration We don't have to enter the name of the application manually because we have chosen the license and this particular license is already mapped with The application because it is coming in from the app directly. So the rest of the fields here such as description the vendor Basic information such as it is it is essential to cover all of these because The description field is something which is not a mandatory It is only available for the reporting thing reporting purpose where the description is currently not visible anywhere Even if we fill something here The description can be of a small note or any a brief summary of for what this is being procured and any special note that you Would like to add here So by default, I think G2 crowdsource was fetched from the Salesforce application, so I'm just Tagging the vendor as Salesforce in this case but in the place where this particular vendor is not available and if this is being procured from a third -party seller or a direct seller or reseller kind of then always we can go ahead and click on add new vendor and If this is being fetched from A test CDW So this can be Selected with a type S reseller not as a direct seller and the other field such as the category is something which is not a Mandatory, but the owner is something which is mandatory because there should be someone Who will always be manning this particular vendor in order to have any discussions as such?

>>Prashanth S	14:26
So I'll put my name here And The website is also something which is mandatory and the rest of the information are not mandatory But we have to just remove those which will eventually let us to save this particular vendor here now Once you click on add vendor, it's gonna get added instantly Yeah, and then this is going to be available Instantly right there

>>Prashanth S	14:58
Now if you even if you come back and this vendor is being used for some other Contract as well. This is going to be available as soon as you start typing from the drop -down. It's going to be available and The primary owner is something which is mandatory So we are done with the basic details until the vendor but the primary owner finance IT These are essential part where I was talking about the renewal reminders any payment reminders or any other custom reminders, right? So like how we have the application owner the application finance application IT owner the contracts are also provisioned with the separate owners in order to have the communication maintained seamlessly Because you might have a lot of renewals coming in and in order to stay on top of all the communication that are being triggered From slurry platform. It is also You know equally important to have all these information filled to have the communication rolled out without any Without any issues so that you know All the reminders that are going to be coming in from the automated basis as well as the custom reminders are well ahead in time And it is it is going to help you in making the decisions whether whether or not you would like to move With this contract renewal or you'd like to terminate or you'd like to cancel the agreement With various vendors as such whichever that is that are currently in active status, right? So there are some things which Along with the application owner application IT finance The the contracts will also be notified for all of them as well as the contract owner the contract finance owner and the contract IT owner So from the contracts perspective the the three owners which is like basically the primary the finance and IT are the three owners who will be notified For any communication that is coming in from the platform, basically I'll take a quick pause any further questions until now

>>Ganesh Kumar	16:51
No Sorry, I didn't get that.

>>Prashanth S	16:57
No questions.

>>Ganesh Kumar	16:58
Oh, no, we are good to go.

>>Prashanth S	17:00
Okay. Got it So now that we're done capturing until the owner information The next few set of details is going to be revolving around the payment information So it's I think this is very pretty straightforward Information where we are going to capture As how this looks from the the contracted document And how we have paid for a particular license from the invoices So basically, I'm sure any contract will definitely have a start date and it will definitely have an end date So considering this as a three -year multi -year contract Let's starts from 1st of October 2024 and ends on 27 20 27 30th September Now that the next thing that we'd also be capturing here in most of the cases use cases scenario I've come across by default in slurry we maintain the the same as end date for the renew by date, which is going to be same as the end date that you've Key in on the top here. And the next thing that you would see is the cancel by date. It depends really on the agreement and Depending upon the renewal terms and conditions that each vendor has defined It's pretty much in order to make more decision and more Time more rooms for making the informed decisions by default I think we can maintain either 30 or 60 days before so that this gives you a notification that you know You need to cancel by 1st of August 2027 in order to not to move ahead with the particular contract, right? So in the place where this information is not provided we would by default consider this as same as end date again Which is basically 30th September 2027 we can either use the predefined ones such as 30 60 and 90 days before or we can definitely go ahead and make use whatever that has been specified in the the agreement level or from the Invoice in order to keep a track of the upcoming cancellation and the upcoming payment So the next thing that you would see is the payment term.

>>Prashanth S	19:03
So these are again nothing but The the terms that are being defined for each of the payments and its frequencies, right? So how well we are going to define the frequency is going to be either a Contract that you have signed up or a subscription that you have procured May be having may might have a different set of frequencies that that you define with different set of vendors so the one time here denotes that the payment has already been made and The payment is which which refers that the payment is made upfront there are no other pending payments that are needed and In the place where you're defining the frequencies as recurring And that's when you will have to define the right frequency here So for example, if the payment is getting repeated every month on month or every one year once for the multi -year contract Since this is being a multi -year contract. Let's take an example of a recurring

>>Prashanth S	19:55
Recurring payment and the payment repeats every once in a year and what you see under this if it is going to be the payment paid in well in advance then that is denoted in a way that the payment is made in advance, paid in advance basically. And the other intervals that you see that net 7 till net 90 are the usual regular intervals that any vendor provides you in order to make the payments and clear off the payments as well. So the most common scenario that we've come across in most of the invoices such as for Sas contracts, it is going to be net 30, right? So what happens here is now that the payment for the first year, the 1st October, the payment automatically calculates and the first payment is going to be occurring on 30th October 2024. And similarly, likewise, what you see after this payment has happened for the upcoming year, it will still be the start date is going to be the 1st of October 2025 and the payment, the upcoming year's payment is going to be, it will happen on 30th October 2025. So the difference is the net 30 that we have selected. Similarly, if we have selected net 45, then the payment is going to occur on that particular date. I hope I am clear here, right? Any questions?

>>Ganesh Kumar	21:17
Yes. Yes. Yes.

>>Ganesh Kumar	21:30
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

>>Prashanth S	21:46
Yes. Yes. Yes.

>>Prashanth S	22:20
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Go ahead.

>>Divya Aphale	22:26
Prashant, also correct me if I am wrong, but apart from this cancel by date reminder notification that will go out to the contract owner or the other owners, right? This is an addition or on top of the other auto reminders that we send for contract renewals, right? Yes. This is an automated reminder.

>>Prashanth S	22:46
On top of that, the custom reminders are going to be the additional reminders. Yeah. Yeah.

>>Divya Aphale	22:52
Custom reminders are going to be the one that probably Praveen and Ganesh will set up going forward. But I am talking about the auto reminders that go out, let us say 15 days, 30 days, 60 days in advance of the contract end date.

>>Prashanth S	23:04
Yes. Yes. Yeah. You are right. So that is something which I will be walking them through under the renewals section. But since we have covered it now, it is going to be 1, 15, 30 and 60. These are the numbers. These are the numbers that the reminders are going in currently for all the contracts. It should be like in reverse way, it is 60, 30, 15, 7 and 1. There are 5 automated reminders that is going to occur for all the contracts depending upon the end date. Okay. And we will move to the next one. What you see here under the payment method is something, it is a different section where if this is added from the spends section, basically this comes under the transaction part. If we have any examples such as Microsoft contract are procured using any credit card or debit card or international, the multi -purposes cards that we can use for the payments and that is when we should be able to key in here. But these are not used currently. If at all you have any usage that you would like to have the payment method added, I will show you how that is also added. That is just 2, 3 simple steps that we can do. And the agreement type here, we are not touching anything upon here. We have a separate place where we will be defining the type of the document under the checklist here. So that is one thing. And for the auto -fetch licenses that we are currently dealing with the first use case. So this particular contract will definitely have a true up because there might be an increase in the number of licenses or there could be a decrease in the total number of licenses as such.

>>Prashanth S	24:49
So let us leave this as no for now because this is being captured automatically from the integration.

>>Prashanth S	24:54
And this happens between the admin console of the application from your end and between this Lurie platform as such. So whenever there is a true up, in Sas context, the licenses are getting increased with the number of seats being increased. So those increase, those increment and the variation, it is captured with the total cost, the amount, and the date as on which day that the true up occurs. And everything is being captured automatically by the system itself. So now, considering this is a manual added contract, and that is when we will definitely be not aware of when the true ups are going to happen. So that's when, if this is starting from 1st of October, then the true up frequencies can be set every six months once as such. And the first true up date is going to be somewhere around March 1st. So this is going to give you an auto reminder saying the true ups are expected so that you can add, again, the increased number of licenses to the system if it is a manual contract. But in this case, let's leave it to no. And this is being an auto -fetched license. And the last one that you see under the basic details is cost amortization. By default, we keep it for months. As any financial institutions or any financial tools we consider, the amortization table is going to be based on the month that we project. So for example, if we are procuring about a contract for $12 ,000, and we would like to see the month -on -month cost that is going to be occurring from the reporting perspective, the cost amortization should be kept as months by default.

>>Prashanth S	26:48
And this is nothing going to be basically how the cost is going to be distributed across the months that we have paid for a particular contract. So this is going to be like if you place a cursor on the I here, this is going to give you a brief description. According to the option here, we will always recommend that the months to keep it in months. And this would work best. This has worked for many other customers best. So this is where we'll be uploading the document. And we will also be making use of a test document here. Just one second. I'm just making a random document upload. And once this is done, we can go ahead until the upload happens. You can always come back and turn all of these on. Whatever that is not required, you can still go ahead and click on the Delete icon here. And whatever some other additions that you'd like to be added here, you can always go ahead. And this is instant. You just click outside and turn these on. And now that we'll be selecting the right type of the document here, considering this as an invoice, this is where we'll be selecting the right type of the nature of the document. And I'm selecting this as invoice. And this is pretty much about the checklist. We don't have much to be discussed anything here. And now that we already have the license that we selected, as you see, the true up automatically occurred here.

>>Prashanth S	28:30
It automatically says that since this is being an autofetched license, the true up has automatically occurred. So now we just have to go ahead, edit the name of the license here. So for example, if this is going to be the license, I'm copying the same and pasting it under the description as well. The start date, end date is going to be the same as that of the ones that we defined from the basic details section. And if we are to split the cost per year, this is going to be for the entire term. And now that you'd like to see the cost, maybe if at all this contract is being signed for multi -years and the cost is being varied for every year, and that's when all we have to do is just simply click on split quantity. And this is going to give you an option to add another split accordingly. So since this is being a three -year contract, the first year's cost is going to be, we can still move ahead with the dates. So this is going to be until 30th September 2025, just for a year. Now you can just go ahead. And the cost is going to be, say, for about 100 per year. And the quantity will still be around, say, for about 1 ,000. And the next thing that you would see here is going to be the 1st of October 2025.

>>Prashanth S	29:53
2025 and this is going to be with an exact year which is 2026 and the last one is going to be the 1st of October 2026 and 30th of September 2027. So now we have a cost variation and that is when we need to split the licenses accordingly. For example, if the last previous year was 100 and the next year you are paying 150 there is an increase increment and the next year you are paying 200, right. Everything should be in year because we are calculating the entire cost per year, right. Now that assuming the quantities are very less so for 10 and let us say again 10. Now you always have the option to link the document whatever we uploaded we can go ahead and upload and we can link the document right next to it. Copying the same and pasting it here and we are just making a slight variation here such as year 2 and year 3. So, this is going to be giving you a quick in from a quick view this is this is pretty much straightforward understood that you know these this is the cost is being computed for all the 3 years such as year 1, year 2 and year 3 as such, right. So this is pretty simple and what you see here on the top is the license type whether this is a usage based or a seed based. So, basically the seed based licenses are something which can be defined in a way that those feeds which requires an individual license provisioning which is like you know for example, Microsoft, Slack, Google workspace everything is going to be considered as a single license where it can be the usages are allotted just for the single user single person usage and the usage based licenses is something which is measured in terms of a different set of metrics and the KPI, right.

>>Prashanth S	31:53
For example, I can consider the Docusign, I can consider Vida. So, all of these comes with 25 ,000 signatures per month these are not measured in terms of seeds, right. So, these are considered in terms of usages. So, most of the campaign related SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Mailchimp and Marketo and any marketing related SaaS applications which comes up with larger amount of usage, right. That comes with large campaigns that can be run that can be run for every month. These are not assigned for individual users rather than it's considered as a usage based and you just place the cursor on the eye here this is going to give you what the definition is the how the charges are being made and how the vendor sells each of these information here. So, there are two types of licenses which is basically seed based and usage based and the scopes are auto fetched and the manually added licenses. So, now we are all set here considering the G2 crowd licenses are something which is based on the usage. Let's assume that they have about 10 license here rather than 1000 and now once everything is done here we are going to set the cost to pro rata. So, the difference here is except that for the pro rata the months quarter and years are pretty straightforward where irrespective of whether the licenses are being used or not the cost is going to be calculated for the entire month quarter and year, but for the pro rata this is going to give you the cost that are being calculated until the till date basically. So, for example, if you are in the mid of the contract life cycle there can be view where this is the particular contract is showing you the cost till date the year till date as well as the month till date right.

>>Prashanth S	33:45
So, that is how we need to differentiate between the pro rata and the other months quarters years and years, but these are not something which we are not restricting the customers to keep it for months quarter and years, but if you prefer that you know you would like to keep this for years definitely you can go ahead and keep this for years and the cost is going to be calculated for the entire year and the quarter and months as such. So, now that I would always recommend we keep the cost as pro rata here right. So, that the minimum duration of the cost will be applied for all of these licenses basically and once you click on everything is set and once you click on the save ok. The last thing that you see is the auto increment. So, this is what I was talking about the true ups. So, when this is being turned on the number of licenses can increase to match the number of users when there is an increase in the users the licenses will automatically be recommended and there is an increase in the number of licenses in your admin console that will automatically be increased in the platform as well Yeah. Prashant, here I have a doubt the quantity where you have split the quantity first year is 10, second year is 10.

>>Prashanth S	34:52
And third year listeners. So first question there is, this is with respect to the same being the same quantity of users. This was just taken as an example. So for example, if you have 100, and next year you have about 200, or the upcoming year you have a different set of numbers, you can just go ahead, add another split here itself.

>>Ganesh Kumar	35:17
Ok, OK, OK. And so that is like the previous 100 is also getting included in the second year.

>>Prashanth S	35:25
Yes, so basically this is for the same set of contract that you're following, but you're taking the quantities as same, right? Because we don't see any quantity changes here within the same contract. But during the mid -life cycle, to answer your question, when there is a change in the quantity, and there might be a change in the date as well, at when this purchase was made, and when this change was happening. So that can be with a different set of dates, such as it could be starting from different set of. So for example, assuming this starts from, there are no changes that are being made. So assuming this, you had procured an add -on kind of thing here, we can just paste the same license name, add -on. And this can be done with a different set of things.

>>Ganesh Kumar	36:18
Ok, got it.

>>Prashanth S	36:19
Yeah, now that you will definitely define the cost here, for example, if this is again 100, and this can be for the entire term, basically. So the term, when I say this starts from 1st August 2025, this is something which is not even. So it starts for two years. So this is something which is for two years, and this can be done for per term, or we can still go ahead and make use of the cost, such as per year. And you're procuring about 50 add -on licenses. And the document that is needed for this particular add -on should be uploaded, and this can be selected from the dropdown here. Now assuming we had an increase, or assuming we had an add -on for the future, but this will be active only from this particular date. Other licenses, such as the current active ones, will be of the 1st October 2024 to 30th September 2025, will be the active one. And you will be seeing only 100 as the total quantity that we have in current, because Zuri considers only the active licenses. Yeah, go ahead.

>>Ganesh Kumar	37:33
One more thing, in case we are taking a license for one year, and then after six months, what we are doing, we are terminating that contract. And then we are creating a new contract with the same vendor, like with additional quantities. Like by default, we are going with 100 quantities. And then after breaking, we are going with 150 quantities, and then with lesser price.

>>Prashanth S	37:56
Yes, yes. So basically, when you're terminating a contract, sorry, sorry to stop you. You go ahead with the question completely.

>>Ganesh Kumar	38:04
Yeah, yeah, after that, with Costanger, like previously, it is an 100 -dollar mint. After that, we are procuring more licenses. And then in that case, the cost will be reduced to $80 or $90.

>>Prashanth S	38:15
Yes, yes. So in that case, to answer your first part of the question, when you're terminating a contract, you always have to notify us as well. So that I'll show you, maybe if we are handling the contracts part, there's an option to terminate the current existing contract, so that the costs everywhere it is getting distributed across from various groups will be removed with a certain time amount and the Sla, basically. And then what we can do, basically, you renegotiated a particular new contract. It could be of a direct seller, or it could be of a new different vendor completely, right? We can still go ahead and upload the new fresh contract, so that only that is being constituted and comprised for the distribution areas. And the cost is calculated based on the groups of licenses that we have in place as such. Because the key element that I understood here is, it is not going to be the same contract. Because you're terminating it, and you're renegotiating it, and you're signing up a new contract. Because that will have new terms, new usage, and everything, right?

>>Ganesh Kumar	39:19
Also, Prashant, it's not only that. We are also finding, like, Futek Gom. We have a contract for three years, and we have done the way we have changed the contract. It's not changed the contract. It's only the pricing that changes. We have updated to the plus version of it.

>>Prashanth S	39:39
Yes, yes, understood. So in that case, what we'll basically do, when you say plus version of that, I'm sure the contract is getting extended, right? So basically, if it's

>>Prashanth S	39:51
If it starts from 1st of January 2023 and 2024 it is ended and you are starting a contract freshly for these plus licenses, it is going to start from 1st of January 2024 and the end date is going to be exactly in a year.

>>Ganesh Kumar	40:09
Yeah that is also a use case, that is also correct but for example if you take LinkedIn, we are in the same scenario but the only difference is at the exact half year point of time we had upgraded to an advanced plus And we are ending the contract at the end of the initial contract and the payments are adjusted based on a pro rata basis.

>>Prashanth S	40:37
Yeah understood, understood. So currently if you see, if there is an existing contract for a LinkedIn and if you are signing up with an upgrade again, are you saying the upgrade and the existing contract are both the same, for both the same licenses?

>>Ganesh Kumar	40:56
Yeah, it is not for the same licenses, I will just tell you the scenario, LinkedIn we have taken 20 licenses, we took it from Jan 1st 2024 to Jan 1st 2025, exactly in June they came up with an option that they need an advanced plus and it is an upfront payment, it is a Pia. We have done a Pia, the contract is running, what they did, they upgraded the 20 license to advanced plus, there what happens is we are for the next 6 months, whatever we have paid gets reduced in the contract and we are only paying the excess amount that is required and the contract stays from June 1st till Jan 2025 1st.

>>Prashanth S	41:51
Got it, got it. So in that case, we can still have a workaround for these because what you can do considering your example, assuming that you have procured something for 1st of October 2024, in this case, let us take an example, this is exactly for a year, right. So what basically we can do here, let the quantity be remaining the same and let it be for a year, but what we will basically do is for Linkedin, I do not think we have a man out of his licenses with most of the accounts, but what we basically do, we will just remove the cost associated with these and make it $0 Or probably we will have to change this particular ones to a formal date. Considering this expires exactly in 6 months, I will take, move forward, March, right. So considering this expires on March 31st, so this is going to be an exact term, right. So now that you had a LinkedIn license and the ones that you procured for an exact year is going to get expired because this needs to be done, this change needs to be done manually for all the manually added licenses, right. Even for the auto -fetch licenses again, we are manually expiring a particular license here, but this can be a subjective one, but Yeah, now I am just giving you an answer. Considering this is expired and we will keep the cost per license as same as 100 per year and the quantity will still be the same, but this is going to be expired within this and now that you have the next upcoming ones, which is basically you are starting on from 1st of March.

>>Prashanth S	43:37
So sorry, it is 1st of April, yeah, starting from 1st of April and this will go until for the next 6 months, right. This is, again, this is exactly for a 6th month again, starting from April to September, this comes, this automatically calculates it for the next 6 months. Now the additional quantity, say for example, you had done an upgrade within Advanced Plus from 100, you are upgrading it to 200. So these two are the only ones which is going to be under this, but for now, I am removing all of these. So this is how the licenses can be managed within the existing contract itself, all right. So now that we are all good here and once we have set the cost, apply cost and everything, we can still go ahead and save this. You will also see some of the additional parts here where the cost is calculated 100 per year with the quantity 100, 5000 and 200, 150 per year, everything.

>>Prashanth S	44:50
That if you have multiple set of licenses so something like you know G2 crowd you also have some other licenses such as apart from the the original name something like that then that's when we'll be adding another line item but for the same licenses we'll just be splitting the quantity And we'll define the right start date and end date for all the quantities and we'll just keep it under one line item here but for it if it is going to be like a multiple license with the different titles different names then that's when we'll be adding as a separate line item here I hope that And also you'll see some additional features such as adding a discount in two categories one is percentage and the other one is USD considering percentage I think if you just specify say for about 5 % then the system automatically calculates the percentage or if you'd like to enter it something in USD about 500 it will still be calculating it automatically and adding a one -time fee here this is something which is something like an editable fee it could be of any implementation or if there is no implementation fees associated with this there could be of taxes or any one -time fee Right so for example assuming this has some tax about thousand five hundred this is going to be calculating it automatically and likewise you can add any other like we don't have any limitation on this you can add in multiple one -time fee depending upon the needs here So if it is having some miscellaneous fees around it for example additional thousand five hundred and that can be added accordingly now once you click on next this is going to give you a quick review of whatever things you have added before that we need to select the right currency here because we may deal with multiple procurements and multiple different set of currencies here

>>Prashanth S	46:44
Right so right now we're keeping it standard ones which is USD if it is INR then it's still go ahead and select this accordingly and we can click on next and all we have to do is click on add contract here it's not working I think I'm facing some

>>Ganesh Kumar	47:16
Yeah

>>Prashanth S	47:17
So okay

>>Prashanth S	47:29
So let this page be there I'll just quickly switch to the new tab so that you know I can just take you through how a contract will look like after it is being added Yeah So let's take slack as an example now that we've added the contract this is going to be this is how the contract will look like just a quick second Yeah Sorry it's got added just now so now that if you see all the information that we added for the G2 crowd this is going this is how this is going to be looking like it's going to give you the status of a contract the app name and the vendor and the primary owner since we have not captured any additional information for financial idea negotiation this is how it looks like adding a payment method is again a simple step where if we have the cards and everything predefined under the expense section we can still come back and edit this it's if the step is missed under the basic metadata collection and now that this the original start date and the end date you can still go ahead and add any custom reminders here So for example if you'd like to add 90 days 60 and 30 you'd like to maintain then that can be added here for example if you just add 90 90 days here you can set the reminder and that's gonna set instantly and if you just click on custom end date reminder this is how it is going to be appearing on the 2nd of July 2027 you'll be getting a reminder and likewise you can add multiple reminders as well for this

>>Prashanth S	49:15
So for example if you'd like to add 60 then that's going to be available from there and the cancellation reminder is something which is an automated as well as you also have the option to set it for a custom reminder as well you can set these one for 90 and another one for 75 so you can still go ahead and play around this and the next payment date again this is just again another reminder which happens by itself there are custom payment reminders are not set but the payment reminders will already automatically happen

>>Prashanth S	49:49
On the upcoming payments, which is basically on the dates. And if you'd like to have any custom payments reminder set. So for example, if the payment is happening on 30th October, if you would like to set a custom reminder about 15 days before, then you can still go ahead and set the reminder accordingly in here. So this is pretty much about managing the reminders and the renewals. So under the renewal section here, it's going to be basically depending upon the number of contracts that we have. So for example, if it is going to be falling for any renewal in the upcoming year, if you just click on it, then you can select all or you can select the payments or you can select the contract. And for the renewal reminder, again, this is a one -time reminder again. On top of this, this is an automatic reminder. You can still go ahead and set a one -time reminder on top of this by receiving an additional reminder on these. So this is something like a renewal calendar view, but you still have the list view here. You can still see what are the contracts that are currently in place. And this is going to be an automated reminder that's going to be available. So for example, if the end date is 30th September, 2027, you can still go ahead and set one additional, a one -time reminder, which is like basically, if you'd like to get this before, say for about 100 days, let's say 90 days again, and you can still go ahead and set the reminder. And this is going to get you another automatic renewal reminder by 2nd of July again. This is pretty much about the renewals. And the last thing that you'd see are the vendor.

>>Prashanth S	51:31
So the vendor list is something which is captured as and when a particular contract is being uploaded. So now that we've captured everything, there could be some delay in order to reflect all of these vendors. The ones that we added is something which is immediate, but this should be reflecting it maybe during the upcoming sync, because I don't see the vendor that's currently added. The TCDW is not displayed here. It should be updated in less than some time on that. So for example, if this is the vendor that you added, if you just click on Google, then this is going to take you to the vendor overview page and the type and everything, the status and everything is going to be available. And this is going to give you the annual spend for each of the vendors that you're making for this particular contracts and everything. Now that if you click on the contracts, this is gonna give you all together, all the contracts that you have under this particular contract, right? So just go back to the vendors. Yeah, this is added just now. And now if you see, if you click on contracts, there should be one contract under this particular vendor and the cost per term is automatically calculated and the start date and end date that you have an agreement with this particular vendor is going to be automatically available here, Okay? So this is pretty much about the first use case that it covers a lot more, but we still have seven more minutes. I can quickly cover how to add manual licenses. It's just the same step that we are gonna follow. So once you click on the application, you can just search for G2 Crowd here.

>>Prashanth S	53:19
Now you click on it and now you see this three dots, right? You click on this, you have the option to add contract, add subscription and add purposeful here. So now once we click on this, the same steps that we are gonna follow, we just have to type the name of the application and this is going to be available from the dropdown and the rest of the other information such as vendor, primary owner, the IT, the finance owner, capturing all these primary information are still going to be the same steps that we followed for the auto -fetch licenses that we just saw. So it's just pretty much the same, but I'll just quickly show you how a subscription is added with just some minor difference here. Let's take an example of G2 Crowd and the vendor name is going to be again, Testcdw. This is going to be available from the dropdown and the primary owner is still going to be the same. I'll take my name on this and Yeah, we are gonna define only the start date. For example, this is a subscription which starts from 1st of October, 2024 and the renewal term is set for every one month once. So ideally, this subscription can also be every yearly once as well as every monthly once, but we always recommend that if a subscription, this model is always considered as month on month payment model. Similarly, we have contracts separately, right? So in order to...

>>Prashanth S	54:48
Consider the other agreements and the model for multi -year and a single year or more than six months and seven months, not crossing, not crossing a year, we would still consider that as a contract rather than the subscription year. Because that's going to give you a more accurate costing, costing information and the spend analysis for a particular document and for a particular application as such. In this case, let's see, let's take, starts on 1st of October and the renewal term is automatic. It renews, it auto -renews every one on, every month on month and the first renewal date that you see is going to be 1st of November, 2024. Yeah, and you see the auto -renews, this is something which we can turn off and turn on. This is always recommended if an agreement is considered with an auto -renewal on for every month or a subscription date. And the cost of monetization is still the same, we will keep this in months and we will move to the next. This is where we upload the document and we'll just turn on of whatever that is needed. And we'll move to the next, assuming the document is uploaded. And here, again, we'll just be seeing the cost, entering the name of the license and the description can be the same. And the quantity here, say for about you have three, three seats or three usage -based, we just saw seat -based and we consider this as a usage -based and the cost per month is going to be about 15 and we'll define it for per month. And we can just go ahead and save and 15 per month and the quantity is three, which is multiplied and the cost is going to be 45. And here as well, you will still be able to add discount and one -time fee.

>>Prashanth S	56:30
But I would always recommend that for a subscription model, we might not have a particular one -time fee for the next upcoming month as well. So we would always have, if at all we have a subscription, we would, if it is a multi -subscription, multi -licenses per month, and if it has any taxes, we would always recommend that this tax is already included in this. So for example, if it is 15 and you're seeing an additional $3 cost for the tax, I would always come back and put 18 per month so that the tax is only for this particular license and this particular month. And from there onwards, this is going to be calculated 18 per month and the cost is going to be 54 for all the months basically. So in this case, I'm considering reverting back to 15 and assuming that there are no tax at all. So it's 45 and we can still go ahead and click on next And we'll just quickly add subscription here and this is going to get added instantly. And there are no much of reminders or anything for these. It is just that we'll have to, since this happens month on month on an automated basis, right? This is a usage -based. Yeah. So this is the difference between adding a contract with the Autofetch license and adding a contract manually and adding a subscription manually in here. And there are two things again, when it comes to the licenses. So for example, if you'd like to, yeah, go ahead.

>>Divya Aphale	58:03
Yeah. Hey, so sorry to interrupt Prashant. I will have to drop off for the next meeting. You can continue for the next 5 -10 minutes and if Praveen and Ganesh have any questions, you can check that as well. But I hope this is helpful, Praveen and Ganesh. I will also share this call recording with you for your reference so that you can go back to the recording and view it if you have any questions later. I'll drop off in a minute, but please feel free to continue.

>>Prashanth S	58:30
Yeah, sure. Even I have a hard stopper.

>>Divya Aphale	58:33
Okay, right.

>>Prashanth S	58:34
I have to jump on the next call, but Yeah, I can continue for 5 minutes and I'll just wind up.

>>Divya Aphale	58:39
Sure. Thanks so much.

>>Ganesh Kumar	58:41
Bye.

>>Prashanth S	58:41
Thank you. Okay. Okay. So now that we've added everything, so as the next step, what we'd basically be doing is I think we'll definitely have to, I mean, have a follow -up session again, because we've not covered with the license management yet, because after the contract is uploaded, how to map the licenses to the users from these particular contracts and everything, right? So I think that I will definitely have a follow -up session arranged from, quickly refresh, Yeah. Now that, but I can just quickly give you a quick brief of what is what. So the next upcoming session, I'm sure I'll cover all of these. So now we have covered most of the things and the payment method is where you see the payment methods are here, and you'll be able to just come to the transactions module and on top, you see the payment methods and you click on add, you can choose whether you're adding a credit card or bank account and other. So if you're adding a credit card, then you can just go ahead and.

>>Prashanth S	59:47
Type the name here, the last four digits of the credit card and choose the card whether it's Visa, Master or the Amex and the expiry date accordingly and default currency accordingly and with just these steps are filled you can just simply click on add card and this is going to get added instantly. So assuming the card is added now that you can still go come back and edit the card or delete the card accordingly in here. That's as simple as it once this is done you would be able to come back whenever you see the payment methods are not filled in for these particular instance you can just come back and add the card this will get instantly saved from the overview itself. So that's one thing and the licenses are something which is basically for example credo users this is an auto fetch license where the licenses get mapped automatically there is no manual intervention needed for these right. So when there is a contract that we upload and and that is uploaded in terms of a manual upload and that's when we have to just go inside and we can just see this the consumed quantity is still zero and the unassigned is 175. So if you just click on these 175 it will take you to the mapper page and from here you will just click on map manually and out of these 175 comes assuming that you are mapping it for five for five set of people and you know the person's name and everything all you can do is just select the account sorry the user name here and you can simply click on add license or probably assign license and the same name of the license should be available from here as well click on it and all these five people will be getting the license assigned to them and the most important thing is to just click on save here and once this is saved this will become a task basically it will appear with the changes in in some time depending upon the changes that we made and considering the stability of the platform this will get definitely synced with the changes and this should reflect in some time.

>>Prashanth S	01:02:01
So that's pretty much about the license assigning But I'll show you more steps in the upcoming call of when there is a lot of users and you'd like to upload in terms of bulk upload and the other things I'm sure we can discuss on the next upcoming call. Quickly pause here and let's understand if there are any questions so far.

>>Ganesh Kumar	01:02:23
No Prashanth, things were clear except for one you can take it there was an option when you did the contracts like renew an existing contract Yes so that is also something that we can explore in the next call.

>>Prashanth S	01:02:38
Sure sure definitely we can definitely explore. So I will definitely reach out to Divya and check for the availability of all of us who are part of the call today And I'll also give her a couple of slots based on our calendars as well and we can definitely connect in the upcoming call.

>>Ganesh Kumar	01:02:57
So normally we have our connections that's happening between on every Wednesday between 4 to 5 mm -hmm Yes other than that other than this timing if we can take up another timing it is cool any day.

>>Prashanth S	01:03:12
I think 4 to 5 p .m. Works for me But I'm a little skeptical about the next upcoming week So I'll quickly check this And I'll get back to Divya on this.

>>Ganesh Kumar	01:03:23
Sure.

>>Prashanth S	01:03:24
Okay all right all right thanks Praveen.
