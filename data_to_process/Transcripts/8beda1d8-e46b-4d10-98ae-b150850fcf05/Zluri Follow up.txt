>>Rishav Ram	00:00
I got me.

>>Courtney Hale	00:01
I'm there.

>>Rishav Ram	00:02
How are you doing today?

>>Courtney Hale	00:04
How are you?

>>Rishav Ram	00:05
I'm good. I'm good.

>>Courtney Hale	00:06
Sorry about that. Just a few minutes later than I wanted to be.

>>Rishav Ram	00:11
No worries. No worries. I understand. Awesome. How's been your evaluation for Sas management been so far?

>>Courtney Hale	00:19
It's okay. We it's a little difficult because we've got we had a company wide meeting last week. We've got a bunch of people out this week because the fall break couple people next week because the fall break. So haven't made much progress yet, unfortunately.

>>Rishav Ram	00:37
Got it. Did you have a chance to discuss with the management at all?

>>Courtney Hale	00:41
No, not yet. I have not.

>>Rishav Ram	00:43
Got it. Got it. So how does the process look like in your company? Courtney, if I have to ask you, right? So if you choose to move forward with story, what are the process involved? Or do you want me to give like a demo to other stakeholders? How does that work?

>>Courtney Hale	01:02
Potentially. So I guess what I'm working on is I'm just meeting with some different platforms and then just taking notes, giving that off to my attorney And then my attorney will take that to our executive board. And then I think I'm not sure what that looks like. I'm assuming they will pick the one that they would like to try or maybe a couple And then have them give our executive team a demo of the platform And then they'll probably pick after that.

>>Rishav Ram	01:36
Got it. And what do you think of all these process? How much time does it take generally? Have you purchased a platform before like reaching out to story?

>>Courtney Hale	01:48
Um, I have not personally, but yes, I know our company has and my hope and again, I don't have a deadline for this. I haven't been told like we need something in place by this specific date. But I'm hoping to have something in front like a meeting with our executive board happen hopefully by the beginning of November, if not mid November, and then hopefully something in place beginning of December, mid December is my hope. But again, there's no deadlines from management or anything like that.

>>Rishav Ram	02:27
Got it. Got it. Understood. Got me. Any other questions you wanted me to ask like any anything related to slowly that I can help you with at this point?

>>Courtney Hale	02:39
I don't think so. I took a lot of notes our last meeting and I just went over those again yesterday, kind of putting together notes for my attorney. So I don't think so. Nothing new popped up while I was going through those.

>>Rishav Ram	02:53
Got it. From your review until now, do you think slurry can be one of your top vendors out there?

>>Courtney Hale	03:00
Yeah, I think so. We are, there's only two other ones that we're talking to. So yeah, I think definitely it's on. I've narrowed it down to the three. So got it.

>>Rishav Ram	03:12
Awesome. Awesome. Thank you so much for that. Yeah, I think the platform's great.

>>Courtney Hale	03:18
I think it's, it looks relatively easy to use. I like the customization. So yeah, definitely on the list for sure.

>>Rishav Ram	03:28
Awesome. Awesome. So when do you think we can connect next? Like you said, your meeting will happen in the first week of November. Is that correct? I'm hoping.

>>Courtney Hale	03:38
We don't have anything scheduled yet. Again, it just depends. We've got so many, we've got, I think eight or 10 people that sit on our executive board. And I'm assuming those will be the people that make this decision. And so it's just hard to get a meeting where everyone is not on vacation or on break or anything like that.

>>Courtney Hale	03:56
Like that. So that's my hope, but it's not scheduled yet. Got it.

>>Rishav Ram	04:01
Got it. Understood. Sure. So in that case, I'll just keep like a placeholder for the second, first day of the second week of November and we can, we can reconnect. If you happen to speak to your manager before that, feel free to reach out to me. I'll also follow up with some of the white papers that I have, feel free to let me know if anything progress is in between and we can always connect over the call.

>>Courtney Hale	04:26
Okay. Perfect.

>>Rishav Ram	04:27
Awesome. Thank you so much. Courtney. Do you have anything else for me?

>>Courtney Hale	04:31
No, I don't think so. Not at the moment.

>>Rishav Ram	04:34
Awesome. Thank you so much. Courtney for your time. I hope you have an amazing rest of your day. Yeah.

>>Courtney Hale	04:38
Thank you. You as well.

>>Rishav Ram	04:39
Bye. Bye.
