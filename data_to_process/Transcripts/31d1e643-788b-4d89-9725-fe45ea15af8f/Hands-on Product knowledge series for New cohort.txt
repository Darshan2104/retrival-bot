>>Abhilash R	00:00
Probably today we have blocked a one -hour session, so we've already wasted four minutes. Should be fine with this. You able to see my screen, Rohan? Yes, yes. Perfect. Okay. Guys, do you want any recap on directory users? Anybody want to pick up? I'm on the users tab. How do we differentiate these two? And how do we do with group and service account?

>>Shrikaant Iyer	00:28
Yeah, if we can do one quick recap, because last time during the call, there was some issue that was happening with the Awm thing. So, I was a bit distracted, but if we can just do a quick recap. Most of it I got, but it's... I was asking if we can't do it.

>>Abhilash R	00:41
Yeah. Okay, okay. So, the first thing for this categorization that we do is, we need to go to the settings tab. So, from the settings tab, we have a directory settings option, where we get to select from where we should pull the department designation and the users. So, we have given this individual primary source options for each of those metadata for users. So, we do it from here. So, however you set up on this page, on the settings page, that's how the data will display for you on the users tab, right? So, employees, external users, and group accounts and service account is a total number of user count that has been fetched through one source. It could be from the first source that is Sso or the Hrms platform, right? But these are the two platforms where we read these employee data. So, how do we classify users as employees and external as a question, right? So, on the settings tab from the directive management, so when you connect, when a customer connects a Google workspace, we get to read the list of domains automatically. When it is already connected, these are the domains that actually we read from the integration, right? So, this takes like 24 to 48 hours, you get the list of domains. Now, any user is a part of these domains or termed or called to be an employee that you see in the first bucket. If you don't fall into this category, you might be from Abc company, but if you don't fall into this category, then automatically, Zully will consider you as an external employee, right? So, this, I'm sorry, when you go to the users tab, so we have four buckets here. So, the main buckets are employees and external users. So, who are my employees and who are my external users?

>>Abhilash R	02:22
That visibility is what Zully is giving us based on the trusted domains, right? So, how do we read trusted domains? We read it from the integration that we do with the first two integrations. It could be an Hrms or it could be an Sso, clearly. So, any questions here? Navin, do you know this? Yeah.

>>Naveen Kumar S	02:41
Yes, Abhilash. I'm like, you actually took me through all this initially. Okay.

>>Abhilash R	02:48
So, here we have an option to select a department for a user, right? So, it can be your Sso or it can be your Hrms. You don't see your finance integrations here, right? Because we don't fetch or create departments from a finance application. So, you can see most of your SSOs and your Hrms platform. Once you integrated it, only then it will show up for you in this drop -down, right? So, here is an option for us to select. You can actually select groups. So, you also have groups here. For example, you see groups under directory. So, if you select groups, we can fetch the groups from a source like this. That's the group data. So, you won't use a metadata apart from that. You want a specific department data. You choose only department. You go with department data. Yeah. Abhilash, so let's say if we click groups here that fetch details from groups, for example, and customer does not have a group set up, then does the integration still get completed without groups or does it give an error? Integration will still get completed. This is like after integration. So, integration is totally independent of this, what we put.

>>Gaurav J Chopra	03:50
Got it, got it. So, okay. So, if we click groups here and then there are no groups set up. So, do we get any? Then we don't. No. No, we don't get.

>>Abhilash R	03:59
So, for example, say Okta you said, right? Okta you connected and if they have groups set up within Okta, then you select this and save it. Within 24 to 48 hours, you can see groups. If you say, if you don't have groups, you have user metadata like department data, right? So, you also have department data here, right? So, these are departments. For example, these are departments and these are groups. So, in Google Workspace, they might have business units. Those can be groups. They might have created a separate department from Google Workspace and this is why we differentiate between groups and department. So, your question is, will there be any error if you don't have groups? No, because your integration capability is totally independent from this. So, when you integrate an Okta. So, let's go to an integration page. I'm sorry. Under sources and you search for Okta. So, this is connected now, right? So, you want to connect Oauth for example. That was.

>>Abhilash R	04:58
Certain scopes. So in this you see read groups. If it is available, it will read groups. If not, no. But you can still connect it, is the point. So once you click on connect, so you get to add this domain URL, client ID, and client security, you're good to connect. No matter you have the data or not, you can connect with all the scopes. So what if a customer is creating a group after you do the integration, we will definitely fetch it because we have an integration. So automatically we fetch a new group. That answers your question, Dc?

>>Gaurav J Chopra	05:31
Yes, yes it does.

>>Abhilash R	05:34
Okay, let's go back to the settings tab again. So here in our directory management, we have different metadata. So we spoke about groups, we spoke about user metadata. Now we also have a custom field. Now customers have created department with a certain path. So you might have a custom field there. You need to check with the back -end team, can I use this path to fetch a specific department data from Google Workspace? So you should always create a ticket if you're going with a custom ticket. Sorry, so the custom field. Okay, so this department, it's not just you put the name and dot department will pull the data. So we need to verify it from the back -end. If we are good to go, they would give us a green signal and then you just go and save it. Then we can fetch the custom data. If anything is missing, say a forward slash is missing or anything is missing from that particular string, we'll be not able to read the data for a custom field fetching of department. Then tech people would advise what needs to be added and what is missing here for us to fetch the custom field data from a department. Then you save it. So these are the different ways of pulling up the department data. But if you go with an Hrms write, you don't have all this. Say for example, you switch over to Workday, you don't have it. This is purely on SSOs, you have it. So in Workday when you select, you don't have it. So when you select Okta for example, you still have the groups, user metadata and custom field option. Something similar with designation as well. So you can also pull designation based on a specific path and again it has to be validated from the back -end. So this could be the path, organizations .title, forward, whatever else, right? So we need to have the right path for us to pull the data. If it's not coming up from this metadata, we have to pull it through a custom data. If not, you can choose our Hrms platform where whatever they are into, integrate them and choose it and automatically we can pull the designation of the user.

>>Abhilash R	07:20
Alright, we also have user processing and categorization. So these are the things that we spoke yesterday. How do you classify the users? So once you connect an Sso, you get a list of domains. So this is a new feature that we have. Say a user is part of a different domain But he's an employee. So for the benefit of others here, so when you go to the users tab, there are a couple of users here on the external bucket. Say the top three users. These guys are not external users. These guys are actually supposed to be a part of employee bucket and why are they missing is because they are not a part of that verified domain. So what we need to do is we need to add their domain. So for example, globex .com, right? Globex .com is the domain. If it is missing on the verified domain page, you can just go and add it from here. Go to settings page and then go to the directory and here you can add the domain. For example, globex .com is here for example, right? If it's not there, then you can add it is what I'm saying. So you can add the domain manually today. For the last three years, I don't think so we had this option of adding a domain. So we raise a ticket to the backend team, they add the domain and the domain will show up here for us. It's in the 24 to 48 hours. Now we give an option to the customer itself on the UI, they can go and add a domain. Any questions here?

>>Shrikaant Iyer	08:39
All good. Okay.

>>Abhilash R	08:41
Now these three, right, we spoke. Classify all users with emails from below selected domains. With emails with selected domains, this is by default it will be selected. You don't be having this and the selection by default. This is the first selection, that's why you see those users. Next, you can classify the users detected based on the primary source that we spoke about. So employee might have a primary source, right? It can be an Hrms, it can be Sso. So say Sso, we're pulling up department, but primary source that is the employment status of an employee is from a work, say an Hrms platform, right? So if you want to do it from there with the primary source, change it from here, right? And then you also have detected primary sources, the emails from the below selected domains only. Only with this below selected domains and with the primary source you wanted, you select this. There are three categorization now. This is again, this covers all the customers request. This is nothing like, okay, a user cannot be a part of employee bucket and cannot be a part of the external bucket. With these three use cases, we can easily classify the user, external users and internal users here. Clear, right? And just going back to the settings, these are the verified domains and we can also

>>Abhilash R	09:57
Pull up the reporting manager data from whatever source that is available for you so this will populate as I said only if you integrate applications this will not automatically populate for you all Right so you want the metadata from a specific source it has to be integrated directly the onboarding date personally within business unit all right So once you set up this you can see the user data here so you see the user data it has been classified employees and external now how do we classify group and service account anything that you can remember from yesterday's session Dalpati manually manually Yes so you go to employees we get a we export this data say we found some we export this data we found some hundred users from here supposed to be part of a group account or a service account customer would tag that as first and we go do it manually So you can do a bulk update as well say these three users are supposed to be group you can go and change it from here so you can do a bulk update of group and service account from here Clear right so group and service account examples we gave say you've created a group email ID for sending out an email to a sales department or a customer success right it cannot be counted as an employee it's supposed to be a group email account it will be a group and if company is taking some service from a third -party vendor or any kind of integrations for example it could be miscellaneous also it is a service account that's how it's been categorized so this cannot be Zuri cannot automatically read what is the group and service account today all right then the next two tabs are how do you mark the user for onboarding and off -boarding Right so when we come to workflows we have a separate section here called workflows right where you have onboarding and off -boarding here separate session all together

>>Abhilash R	11:45
So But how do you mark a user for onboarding and off -boarding so before you mark a user for onboarding or off -boarding you need to have a playbook created so we'll talk about more in detail but how do you mark a user is pretty easy so you go to a user you set a user for example you can mark the user for onboarding or off Yeah from here and also from here I believe Yeah You have an option to do it and then probably if you go you don't have it here

>>Dalpati Mandal	12:11
Yeah this will directly on burn off we cannot mark them though you can directly take on say you're talking to off board or onboard a user from here this you click this it will take you to a workflow directly it doesn't give you an option to set a specific date when to off -board and on board that's an option you know just one question on the marking group accounts like all of the you know this primary sign on Google workspace or you know any email provider probably was a we are using Google anybody is using Microsoft whenever we try to create a group you know email ID for a group or you know mass communication channel suppose there is we have a email ID for Cse or Csm at all the CS there is a tagging within the Google system also right this email ID is actually a group email ID

>>Abhilash R	13:02
Yeah could be But I'm not sure on that But till today no we don't read group and service accounts automatically if in case if you have it also we don't do it it is manual we don't have an automatic process of reading it here so once you mark for on -boarding off -boarding you can also see the list of users from the user directory right and the next thing is we spoke about the overview Right how do how are we getting the status of an employee so this could be again a metadata that we have done from the settings page I want Robins employee status to come from what source right you click on view all you get to know what is the source the primary source is Google workspace if it is a say it's a Hrms platform it could be with workday for example Right it could be workday or high Bob for example these are so the source why is active it depends on the primary source that is selected under the settings page so this is very important because I said when you pull a report of unbeprovisioned users people who are inactive in your company but still hold a license like for example you go to an application you go to Microsoft and you see the users I want to see out of this users from Microsoft they hold a license of E3 E2 and all right out of this I want to see who's inactive days So I put a status here so I have employment status so this employment status primary source is very important you put inactive and suspended users you want to see those use list of users for example 848 users and this guy is inactive in the company is what we understand But he holds a license right now customer says no this way is not active in the company So what is that you can think of why is it showing at inactive for us

>>Vikram Senthil	14:56
The user might be inactive and deactivated.

>>Abhilash R	14:59
Sorry, so my code is there. I'm not able to hear you well.

>>Vikram Senthil	15:07
Hello? Is that is like the status is something which may be getting from the Sso or from the primary source. So if the user's profile is deactivated in the primary source, then probably we might be getting here as inactive.

>>Abhilash R	15:21
Correct, so that's a good one. Yeah, so probably they told us that, take my primary source for employment status as Hrms, not my single sign -on. On single sign -on, I might retain his licenses. Say I have a deal with one of the customers recently. He said, I want to retain him for next three to five years. So he's been active on the Sso. But as per our report, if our primary source is Hrms, then he will definitely show us inactive. So we're just giving them some heads up. So we need to change that primary source from here. So it could be either from Hrms or Sso. Then you can pull the report. Only then it'll make sense for the optimization. Clear, right? Yeah, so let's go back to users. Let's go to Robin. So that is the status that you see. Now this title, type of, is an employee or an external. So this is where you classify. Now when you do an optimization, right, when you see an optimization report here, I can show you, you see this type employee, correct? Now let's go to an optimization report. You see this optimization report when you take some kind of action on an optimization, right? The report will say what type of employee. Is he an external employee? Is he an, let me show you this. This is estimated realized savings here. So you've done some optimization, the continuous optimization that we spoke. So you have downloaded this report. Say it's Excel, for example. I'm just opening it on Excel. Save this. Now you can see this report. That will have employee type. So whom did you deprovision? Did you deprovision a license for an external user? Do you see this account type here?

>>Abhilash R	17:02
This is an employee, right? You might also see a group account here. You might also see some other, no, there's nothing. So you might also see a service account. So this group account is also removed right now. This is for example. So when you do it for a live customer, you can see the reason why it's been unused for 90 days and he holds an E3 license, but it was a group account, right? So that's why that type is pretty important when you classify the users. Yeah. So that's why we bucket those external and employees separately as an external employees here, right? So that's the type. A job title is coming from an Hrms or a single sign -on. Department is again coming from these two sources. When was he added onto the platform? Onboarding date. So you saw the onboarding date as well, right? So you go to the settings tab. When you have this directory management, at the bottom you see the onboarding date. So this is coming from an Hrms, for example. So every Hrms will have that date. When did you onboard or when did you join the company? So we're getting this from there, right? So those are the same data that you see on a single platform. You see it here, right? That's the onboarding date. Usage score should pop up based on the applications that it's using. So this is an average score that will show you for all the 17 applications that it's using. It's not here because it's a demo data. If you see a live account, you can see what is this overall usage of applications. So out of 17 managed applications, how is the usage going on, right? Next, you have the associations, where he has been associated. So when I say association, when you go to an application, right? This guy might be an app owner, all right? And this guy might be a contract owner. So when you add a contract, say you add a contract here, you add for Zoom, for example.

>>Abhilash R	18:43
Now, when you add it for Zoom, you add a primary owner, you add a finance owner, you add an IT and an acquisition owner. So if this guy is a part of any of these ownership, that associations will show us, say he's a part of five contracts, he's a part of five applications as app owner. So that's the association. Clear, right? Now, let's go to, yeah. So that's the association bit. Here, there's no data for me to show you. This time, just moving on to 214 to other pages. So associations will show you wherever this Robin is associated with multiple integrations, or an app owner, or a contract owner, or a finance owner, whatever owner it is, it'll showcase here for you, right? And this, you guys know, it is a custom field, right? You can actually add more custom fields here, and whatever custom fields that you add, you can always pull a report based on the custom field that you add, Right? You also get email aliases from that particular user. So you will always have his primary email address, his own email address, personal email address, and also his professional email address as well. So always a professional one would be the default one for us to look for the data, right? And what are the other sources we are detecting the user? So we are detecting this user just from Google Workspace. But if you change the primary...

>>Abhilash R	19:55
Source as Hrms this would become a primary source for them and we're detecting this user from all the other platforms as well as what we're showcasing Okay Okay now on the right we have managed apps and restricted apps So we discussed some we gave some examples right like managed apps are pretty important for an IT person to understand out of 96 applications right out of 93 applications how many applications is this guy using it right So that's very important

>>Naveen Kumar S	20:25
Yeah we can hear both of you not why you can't hear him Yes I can can

>>Abhilash R	20:49
You yeah

>>Naveen Kumar S	20:50
I can hear you

>>Abhilash R	20:51
Oh sorry some Siri or something got enabled all of a sudden Yeah Okay

>>Naveen Kumar S	20:58
So when this user discovery happens right

>>Abhilash R	21:01
I mean like it happens purely through the source that is coming through but is it possible that it can also be categorized through the employee IDs also I mean is even that also can be added here if employed is as one of the scope when through the integrations if you are able to fetch the data and if Google is giving us that data through API yes we can so you can add it so for now I guess most of the customers they do they add a custom field let's say employee ID is a custom field they update the numbers manually for the managed applications and users But if Google is allowing us to read the data or Hrms application is giving us data we will definitely read it Okay

>>Naveen Kumar S	21:47
It's part of a scope actually that scope

>>Abhilash R	21:49
Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay So managed applications or the applications pretty important for the ID guys right so out of those 93 or 94 this guy is using 17 applications so is he using effectively is what he can look into that when he clicks on applications yet and out of which how many are licensed and how many are non licensed and all the details will be here for them right and restricted apps so as I said so the company has restricted 300 applications out of which how many of the applications listed apps used by Robin is what we are trying to focus Yeah So you can see the third applications and you can probably reach out to this guy directly and ask I see some 10 applications out of 100 has been used why is it for a business reason then they can take the conversation further from that So that's the visibility for a user this is the total number of applications so in total is got 0 And 17 you see the total number of application that has been used by him on this page and you can see the actual spend for him for this financial year so what is spent for the October and what is the overall spend for the current financial year for all the applications when I say all the applications only the 17 applications that has been used by Robin right for all this you might have see some spend you see the spends per month Right everything put together is that total spend for him for the current financial year and this is $84 in October clearly and remember yesterday we mark this day for off -coding and this pops up here it wasn't showing us today because it took some time so when you mark a user for off -coding here it is so when should be off -boarding off -boarding is for today Right we assign it to a person who can off -board it and say this is a manual off -boarding right it doesn't trigger any kind of rule or anything like that you see this and you click on off -board now you click on off -board now it will go to this it will create a playbook it will add all the 17 applications and out of the 17 applications you might have automatic actions and manual actions manual actions has to be manually removed automatic actions you'll be removed from or knocked off from those applications automatically so that's the workflow bit which will be done probably another couple of days for you guys I will discuss on workflows

>>Abhilash R	24:02
Right so when you click on off -board it creates its own playbook and it creates all the actions for all the 17 applications where you can off -board the user manually Okay And this is the app wise spend graph on different application what exactly has been spent so we saw that application list right some application doesn't have spent this is the all probably like one two three four five applications where we actually see spend for it and that's the 2 .86 K what you see the overall spend for the financial year so just a quick graph to understand how many applications are easy using out of which is paid so it's an app wise spend data for you then you have an add note this can be used for various reasons say I educate customers saying you see some restricted application you from this user you can put a note for yourself because you're the app owner right

>>Abhilash R	24:54
So put a section for a, I mean, put a note for yourself and you can talk to the employee while they're using. And if you see there's very less usage for different applications, you see usages, right? You can also put a, add a comment. So you can see usage here, everything shows like this but on a live account, you might not see this like this. Okay, you might see some one dot. So like very less usage for a highly paid license applications, right? So they can take an action. They can put a note, a custom note and they can remind themselves. That's the overview. Yeah, now we spoke about groups, right? This is covered. Now groups is again coming from the source, right? We have, they have different groups set up. This tag is again coming from the source and you have how many users are part of this group, right? There are three, this many users. And out of these three, out of these many users there are three applications linked with which has been used within this group. And that's the spend only for these three and for these many users, the total cost. Now again, spend is coming from a finance application. Cost is coming from the contract that we upload. And you can also see the source where we're getting this groups. So these are basically groups and these are departments. So this is a department that is actually showcasing for you on the overview page as well, right? You have sales, customer success. So for each department, what exactly is your spend? So you see that we allotted a budget, right? For example, if you go to a specific department you can add a budget for this department. This is some budget added, right? Now the spend that is, this is the monthly spend. What is the overall spend, right?

>>Abhilash R	26:36
This is 9 .83 million that I've added manually out of which this is the overall spend for this financial year for all the applications. That is 485 applications, okay? You can see what budget is remaining here. So because 9 .83 is the overall budget that I set for sales department. So this again has this overview page on this page. You can see that. So say you've set a budget for say 100K And you have a spend more than 500K. Then you see a red bar going here saying that you're going beyond your budget. So it's a quick view of that here as a graph. You can also go to department and see them here as well. So you can see the number of active users from each department out of which how many managed applications are here because why we focus on managed apps is because for IT, managed applications are very important. They take care of the unmanaged and the restricted bucket also later because this is where they're spending more and most of the users are on managed bucket, right? That is their focus. This is like an additional add -on for them to see what is my shadow IT And why restricted applications are used. This is the second thing that they take this tab on. But the first thing they focus on is managed. So this is where you see when you go to users tab, you also see here, you don't see unmanaged bucket, right? You see the managed applications here. Similarly, you see on the department, right? We show the managed apps used, a default column for them, right? Now we are fetching top six departments from Google Workspace. So how did we set this up? We set this up from the settings page. That's why we see the departments here. Yeah. The next thing is the cost center.

>>Abhilash R	28:18
Cost centers are nothing but, say, Zuluri had two locations. For example, we had one in Chennai. It was recently closed. So multiple locations where you operate from. Zuluri was operating from two locations. Say this customer is operating from five, six countries. Okay, you can have cost centers configured on Google Workspace. So when I say cost centers, so it's a different location from where I wanna see how much am I spending for a specific application and a user based on the location. That's the cost center. Again, this data is configured on, it could be configured on Hrms or it can be configured on Sso. So I have a recent customer who was trying to fetch this cost center data from Hrms platform. That is Workday. So, but Workday is telling that they cannot give us the data. So we're trying to do a manual upload of this right now. So I've just exported this. What are the details that I need for a cost center? I need the location name, the cost center code and who's the head of the cost center and how many application, all the spend. So giving it as an Excel sheet, we'll get this uploaded from the backend for them. We're doing a manual approach for now because they have some auditing coming up. If not, if you're integration like Sso or Okta or Azure, right? Google, they have cost centers built. So when you integrate with the scopes, right? You will get to read the cost center data, right? And this happens mostly on an enterprise or a medium -based company. The small -based company, probably they'll be in a one location. And if it is a medium -based or an enterprise account, there'll be like spread across the globe, right? Then they will definitely have.

>>Vikram Senthil	29:53
Different types of cost centers for different operations right any questions here with just for the directory page so for this cost center and as well as in departments so department is something which we are pulling out from the primary source if a customer wants to I mean upload something so that has to be done from the back end right because I saw the option of department

>>Abhilash R	30:19
Yeah

>>Vikram Senthil	30:20
So there's something which you have a pulling out from the primary source Right

>>Abhilash R	30:24
Yes yes it is a settings page here when I go here the first thing is department is what people so pulling up departments I can I'm pulling up group I'm pulling it with the user metadata department I can also pull it through the custom field or I can pull it through a Hrms platform so when you save whatever settings that you do for department here your department should be pulled it depends on customer how they have set up where they've set up department is it on your Kaka Platform or is it on your the Google workspace platform so based on customer where they've created we can pull a department from them Okay But like for departments and cost centers if a customer is requesting to import it manually or something do we facilitate that option first of all the only reason I see if for the manual upload in case if the API is not giving us the apartment data through the Hrms or through the Google workspace or any Sso then we can do it from the back and we can upload the department from the back Yeah But as I said cost center we supposed to get it from Google workspace they've connected Google workspace But but they have their cost centers enabled on workday Hrms platform but workday they're not enabling that API for us So we're not able to read the cost centers through workday integration so we're doing a manual approach we're trying to upload it manually got it thank you Yeah Anybody has any other question well can we move on to this license bit I'll just give you a quick run through on how do we do it I guess now when is doing a lot of contract upload so he's aware of this we've also gone through a couple of tabs here to understand so first thing why do we need this is it's pretty important

>>Abhilash R	32:13
So if you see your application tab I said out of 93 managed applications again I'm stressing on that managed applications because it's very important for IT right out of this 93 79 application doesn't have cost per license data because there is no contract cost is coming from a contract right now this widget tells me manage apps with no cost So only only probably or 20 applications has it contract data that's why we were able to show the annual contract cost here and the total cost that you see on the overview page but how about the 79 applications can we get those contractors pretty important now what you have to understand is when I go to licenses when I do direct integrations with global applications like Google zoom slack these are the global applications they would give us the cost per license data through the API when you integrate an application from here when you go to sources and integration right there are quite a few I heard it's like closer some 20 to 25 application gives you that license data through the API So I have connected Google so Google will have that capability to give us the data now how do I identify an autofest license through API and how do I identify an application which we have manually uploaded there's a question so when I go to licenses you see a green dot here Right these are the autofest licenses for Google workspace for example so this 400 is coming through the API right And this consumed quantity data is also coming through the API clearly if you see there are other application without the green dot these are manually uploaded so this is manually uploaded these are autofest these are autofest again

>>Abhilash R	33:58
Right So if you see there are only few in this demo data you can see more actually we can see if they've uploaded more contracts you can see more contracts are uploaded manually here right another thing that you have to understand is we read this data through API now we still ask customer the contract it doesn't mean that we get the we just get the quantity here we get the quantity we get the consumed quantity and we get unassigned quantity so what does it mean is they have procured 400 licenses for Google out of which 254 is consumed or it means it has been assigned to the employees 146 surplus or unassigned quantity right and why do I need a contract now because I'm already getting an API data right any nothing that you guys can think of cost the cost exactly so the cost cost will never

>>Abhilash R	34:52
Come through the API. Even though you do an integration, cost is never passed on through the API. The only reason what I see is because say Google is sold for $10 for you. And I'm a customer from past 20 years, they might sell it for six or $8 because I'm using I have a business account and I'm using it for past 20 years. So the amount will vary from customer to customer, right? So they don't give those details through API. That is one of the reason when I check with the I spoke to a Google support guy. That's, that's the reason they don't share those details actually from Google. Because the pricing is different for each customer. Right? So to get the pricing, we need the contract. And we have a back end team CS ops team, they will they will actually upload the contracts for us. You have to just share the PDF file, and they will upload it for us. So what they do is they I actually just I connected 24 hours ago, I connected Google. And I see this 400 seat that is quantity based license has been pulled through the API because I see a green dot here. Now when customer gives me the contract that is actually signed, they will share a PDF file with you, right? If you go check, they will have the same number, they might also have a different number with the same set of license. Reason being they would have procured something more as well. But what our back end team will do is they'll click here, and they will upload on top of it, they'll just click and they'll go upload a contract. They won't add it separately is what I'm saying. They won't add it as a separate line item. They see that okay, this Google workspace is for enterprise license, for example, that's the type of license. Okay, so what they'll do is they'll go and upload it on top of it. So you get an option to add, I'll show you another one.

>>Abhilash R	36:35
Everywhere it is added. So it will say as add contract or subscription. Okay, when it is when when customer provides us the actual contract, we just go check if it's automatically fetched on top of it, we add the actual contract. So when you add the contract, you can also add the document here for your reference, there's an option to add the document and save it so that in future you can just have to say they have to, they have some discrepancies on the numbers or the count of license procured, you can always verify the document. Okay, so the first thing that I understand is on the license tab, you have all the licenses, right, everything manually added, automatically fetched, everything will be on this bucket. That is the license tab. Now, Zuluri accepts licenses or contracts in three ways, right? One is contract basis, the other one is a subscription, the other one is a perpetual. Now contract will have a start and end date. That's how they understand when a PDF is passed on to the back end team, how do they understand if it's a contract will be on the contract saying it's a contract for one year, it's a contract for multi year Or it's a contract for three years, right? Based on that, they go to contract and they click on add from here, they add a contract on it. Okay, that's a contract. And what are the subscription could be anything like that we use on a daily level, say I use Netflix, for example, on a monthly basis, as I subscribe, I can use that, right? So if they're using vendors consume here as a subscription, it will be mentioned, it will be on the contract for you. Okay, so subscription will not have an end date, it will just have a start date. So if you go to a contract, for example, so you're doing it for zoom, you're adding it as a contract.

>>Abhilash R	38:15
Now, right? You see, there's a start and end date here, right? We have a start and end date when it will cancel when it will renew and all, but this won't be there for a subscription because it's on a subscription module, right? The same zoom application, I'm adding it as a subscription. So you have this kind of terms, right? It could be months, every two months renews or things like that. So subscription will have a different condition. And perpetual can be a quarterly one or a six monthly one, it will have an end date also. Okay, so very rare you see perpetual contracts, the most of the contract that we see is contracts and subscriptions. Any questions? Yes, sorry.

>>Shrikaant Iyer	38:57
What's the difference between a perpetual and a contract? Is it just the duration?

>>Abhilash R	39:01
Duration would be a little not like a multi year contract or one year contract could be a monthly end. See, for example, the start date is on first of October, it might end on October 31. For example, it's a purposeful contract. Okay, but it's not a subscription. It's a purposeful contract. Or if not, it might be a quarterly contract. It will start now and it'll end in December 31. But it's not a yearly contract. It's not a contract. Actually, it's a purposeful contract.

>>Shrikaant Iyer	39:27
Okay, but it seems a little counterintuitive because perpetual means something that is lasting. So I would assume perpetual means something that is there for a longer duration.

>>Abhilash R	39:41
It can be longer duration, but when you get a purposeful contract, right, you have this, if you see there's only a start date here, right? You you might have you might not have

>>Abhilash R	39:51
Proper end date for a perpetual one.

>>Shrikaant Iyer	39:54
Like a proper contract. Like with an auto -renewal that there is no... Like it's basically like a lifelong thing is what I would assume is perpetual.

>>Abhilash R	40:04
Not exactly a lifelong thing. What I've got... What I got to know was the postal contract that I wanted. Navin, any contract that you've entered for perpetual?

>>Naveen Kumar S	40:15
Nothing yet.

>>Abhilash R	40:17
Yeah, very rare. Even I've seen a perpetual contract. But I saw one with this quarterly it was. It was 3 months, just 90 days actually. So it was a perpetual contract. It was actually mentioned on the contract. Not a lifetime contract that I would see.

>>Vikram Senthil	40:34
Abhilash, I have a question. So basically, like subscriptions. Like we already have license tab which shows the total number of licenses that has been purchased or probably assigned to a particular user. If we are having a particular section for subscriptions, subscriptions are basically like a monthly subscription or basically it's a kind of a plan that we are letting customers know like what are the plans that you have subscribed for the application that you are using currently. Or is it something related to the plan that a user is assigned to? Because I'm a little confused because we all have contracts as well as licenses. So contracts let us know like what's the time period. I mean, the multi -year contract or it's an year contract or what's the timeline that we are going to have this license as well as the mutual things. But with subscriptions, are we defining it's like monthly payment subscriptions or is it something like the plan definition that we are giving via the subscriptions?

>>Abhilash R	41:31
That's again, those data will be available for you on the subscription that you have subscribed for. And you can see here there's an option. Say you subscribe for something today. And if it's every one month, you can mention that. So you might be paying every month for it.

>>Vikram Senthil	41:46
Okay, so what I'm understanding here is like subscription is something that it lets me know that what's a ready -made term for this particular product. Let's say like I'm subscribing for Slack. So if I'm paying it on monthly basis, so that's something I'm going to put it across the subscription and it's going to estimate me.

>>Abhilash R	42:05
Yes, and that condition will be on the contract for you. Subscription module will have a subscription mentioned. It's a subscription plan, things like that I've seen for Slack. There are new customers, our own customers, they use a yearly contract for Slack. And there are all customers who use a monthly subscription for Slack as well. So it will be on the document and whatever, however, the type of contract they signed with the Slack company, right? So it will be available for them. Based on that, they would key in the data here.

>>Vikram Senthil	42:36
But I think even in contracts, we have this regular terms and everything, right? Start date, end date.

>>Abhilash R	42:42
In contract, you have start and end date because it's clearly mentioned. If you picked up a contract today and you have an end for next year, 2025, then it's a contract. So you go click and add contract, say Slack, for example. You have an option to choose that here. So you can actually choose start and end date of the contract. Say if it is today and you can choose which, say if it's a multi -year, three -year contract, it automatically will choose the end date because that's the term mentioned on the contract for the customer and the document shared by the customer. Okay. So we go with that. So whatever is mentioned on the document shared by the customer. So even customers will not have visibility on if it is a subscription or a contract. But once we have the data with us, we will get to know because we go through the document and we understand, okay, it's a subscription or a contract. Based on whatever they've signed on.

>>Vikram Senthil	43:36
Got it, Akhilesh.

>>Abhilash R	43:37
Okay. Just give me a minute.

>>Dalpati Mandal	43:40
I just want to understand one thing. If there is an annual subscription and somebody adds that as a contract or if it's a contract and somebody adds that as an annual construction, how will it impact the data that is reflecting here in terms of cost and everything?

>>Abhilash R	43:55
A monthly subscription will remind, say if it's a monthly one and there's a subscription rate, it will remind customers on a monthly basis. We have a default reminder that gets triggered. If it's a contract, yearly contract, you see there's a contract that will have a timeline I can show to you. So you have a timeline, right? So it should be triggering on first of, say this is the end date. By default, our application will trigger 30 days prior to the state, 15 days prior to the state and 7 days prior to the state. That's a proper contract end time. And if it's a monthly one, it goes monthly for them before the end date of the subscription.

>>Dalpati Mandal	44:33
So for monthly subscription, the similar timeline will come, but it will show a month start date and end date, right? Yeah. View remains the same and the rest of the thing remains the same.

>>Abhilash R	44:45
Yes, it remains the same. We can also add custom reminders.

>>Abhilash R	44:50
Is here we'll come in detail to it so this you guys understood know this four buckets basically How do you this is your total number of licenses it could be you say not this is these are not individual applications it could be like one application with multiple type of license as well right this four is But it's considered like one two three four so though this 24 that you see here everything is like one set of a application is multiple type of licenses So when I say multiple type it could be an even license or e3 license or a say for zoom it's a basic or pro or enterprise one like that right So when you integrate it whatever licenses they've procured or they're signed with a vendor everything would be exposed here through the API And we also have this upload option this is for the AI a bit I so you add it from here So I'm not sure on this But we add if it is a contract we add it from here and subscription model which is go ahead from that right we can also see let's look into one single contract for example how do you add a contract we're not talking about subscription or we're not talking about perpetual just talking about a contract say one year contract for example Okay now use you need to select the application name here Okay that's very important as you see a checkbox here right renewing an existing contract so say customers have given us a contract already he's a customer was loony for past two three years they've already shared a contract with us for zoom the sharing a new one just go select this and you add the old contract name here it's like a follow -up with this particular contract the new contract that you're trying to upload okay description is non -mandate anything it's if it's acquired I can add a description now this vendor is very important because it's a mandate field so where are you getting this zoom from which vendor

>>Abhilash R	46:48
So when you add the vendor detail we also have a vendor management created here So when you go here you see under licenses you see vendors here right now these are the vendor details so we have added zenders from zenders we're getting only one contract and one more application but if you see from Microsoft there are two contracts so for you they get a visibility on from each vendor how many contracts do you have so for example on Google there are like four contracts right and who is the owner so that's something that we need to add when you add a contract here let's go back here And then okay now already added vendors will populate for you like this the one which I showed you before in case if it's not available say this is a vendor called Xyz it's not coming up you need to add a vendor you click on add vendor you need to add all the details here once you add all the vendor details here then you can choose that vendor so you probably have to choose that vendor again for another application so you we also help customers in having a contract management and also a vendor management Right So this is a vendor section and we need to have this primary finance IT and negotiation owner again these details are from the document shared by the customer Now I guess we have we have come up with that Ai version of uploading a contract right wherein it should read all this data automatically if what it needs a human intervention to understand if did we enter the proper detail why do we need this details while entering a contract anything that you can think of reminders Yeah basically to understand just figure a reminder and say the term reminder will go to the primary owner finance owner IT owner so there's something like say there is true up clause on a contract

>>Abhilash R	48:37
Okay And they they procured like hundred licenses for the last six months they want to procure another 50 licenses right So there's a spike in the license because this they are the recruiting people for example Right even those data will go to the finance or so you procured more and this is the actual spend versus cost per license and all those details will go to the finance owner so that's why we need all these four owners to be there so relevant data would be triggered from for each owners Okay Next you have the start and end date of a contract so based on this only the notification will trigger if you put a wrong end date Right so instead of October 31st You put a number 31st it will go as an incorrect notification so end date and start date is very important for a contract so based on this system will automatically trigger notification as I said 30 days 15 days and 7 days prior to the end date right And you can also add a custom reminder so you want to be reminded two days before the end date you can do that as well I'll show it to you on the same page now this for you clear right if you have a contract auto renews Okay you can select this auto renewal box

>>Abhilash R	49:49
Here and when you do it is the same in date you can select this box here right and how do you pay for this contract if this data will be there for you on the contract if it's a recurring payment or a one -time payment they can select it accordingly if you have created any payment methods like for example you have an option to create payment methods from the spend depart spend tab that you see on the Dory you can select a specific credit card from where you're spending it Right so you're paying for zoom from this credit card or you can select that here on the payment method right And when are you making the payment like this is for the next term not for the current term Right so it's this is the end date this is cancelled by date and this is renewed date so there's a difference in it Right So most of the time the end date and the cancelled date would be on the same date you have another renewed date so there it's been if it's an auto renewal it will auto renew the next day Right so if it's finishing on 31st of October and 1st of November the contract is renewing it will be for the different date if not you can select this as same date Checkbox

>>Vikram Senthil	50:55
Okay

>>Abhilash R	50:56
This is not mandate agreement type if it is available in the document shared by the customer I can put it so for example I was speaking about true up so true up is a clause where they can they can procure a number of licenses during that contract period it's not that they have purchased 100 count 100 licenses for this first year And they have to wait for to sign up another agreement with the vendor to sign up for a new set of licenses But if you have a true up clause you can actually request for more licenses with it within the same contract

>>Vikram Senthil	51:27
Okay

>>Dalpati Mandal	51:28
And here you have that option so here if we do auto payment and select a payment method there can be a bank transfer as well right

>>Abhilash R	51:38
If we no no we don't do that we just update this is this for our customers update like they want to see from which credit card they paid we don't take care of billing and payments at all from story No

>>Dalpati Mandal	51:50
No I'm asking if you're selecting which credit card and all do we actually trigger a payment that's why I said we don't trigger a payment

>>Gaurav J Chopra	51:58
Okay we don't take care of payments at all we don't trigger anything it's a deal our process ends at sending the notification to the customer from there they have to take it on we are just having it as like a record section to know like how we paid for this contract

>>Abhilash R	52:16
Yeah just just insight for the contract IT owner finance or not to say the contract end by this date And this is the payment this is how you are making a payment also you're making it through a bank for example that's the database that we're trying to show But no payments no billings nothing we do with a third -party vendor through slurry we don't do it so even if it is a auto renewal contract still there has to be a manual renewal the renewal happens with them we notify them we just notify them saying we see a contract with auto renewal for you So if they're not they taking action and they don't take an action again depends on the customer right So once they talk to their vendor they negotiate they come back again they give us another contract document we get that uploaded that's why I said the first option renewing an existing contract we select this and we upload the contract again manually this is just a contract management database that's it We don't we send them reminders we probably send reminders this for one reason because say if they have a contract ending right And I'm doing an optimization I'm trying to save some wastage of license for them So when they they can be ready for the next contract what is the number of licenses that I need to procure right so are we getting the data because they have shared the contract to us so when they go for the next contract they sometimes know it is not there for them they have procured 100 they want another 50 instead of doing an optimization within the existing 100 they might sign up for another 50 again they're spending more there so we cut down on cost for them we try to say that Okay these many users will say they're undeprovisioned uses unused licenses we're going to take action on them and save some licenses so when you go for the next contract you can save some money

>>Abhilash R	54:02
Right you don't have to go for 50 instead of that probably go for 10 because you already have 40 with us No no what I'm trying to understand is that what is the use case of capturing whether it's the auto renewal or not it is a part of the contract because it is a part of that contract so we are telling them if it's an auto renewal again they would definitely go for the next one how do I say for example you have Netflix with your credit card Right you have an auto renewal with it so you've got to cancel it before when before the renewal date

>>Dalpati Mandal	54:33
Right

>>Abhilash R	54:34
But if you're not notified not using Netflix at all from past six months you're paying this thousand bucks every month Right it gets renewed so you you're trying to save some dollars for the customer that's what Lurie is doing there

>>Dalpati Mandal	54:48
Got it, got it. But for that cancellation also, they should have somewhere in their accounts or bank system, they would have put auto renewal or auto payment mandate. We don't know, right?

>>Abhilash R	54:59
We don't have that possibility. But Lurie gives that possibility to the IT, finance, and the app owner, the contract owner, right?

>>Dalpati Mandal	55:09
Yeah. Just a few facts. Number one is auto renewal on payment is a different thing. Most of the invoices or contracts auto renewal means when the cycle ends, then we don't need to go through the process of asking if you will renew or not renew.

>>Gaurav J Chopra	55:24
That is what contractual auto renewal means, which means the vendor can raise an invoice to the customer, whoever the buyer is, which goes to the finance team. Now, is it auto, like an Emi or whatever, or auto payment through their banking system or credit card is something that depends on the finance team. So these are two different things. And we don't even go to that extent. Another thing you see, I know, sorry about that. So it looks like that probably we are doing very minimum. But like Abhilash said, see, it's a very critical feature. So for example, I'll tell you, I was on an AppFire call just today. So a great example on this topic. So we went into the renewal section in the contract. And there was one contract which is expired on 4th of April. There it shows that the last date was two days, three days back, whatever. Now, the customer asked us, how do I know where is my new contract, if it's there or not? So from there, we went to the application licenses and contracts page. And that's where the new contract was already uploaded, because we have a direct integration through their Coupa, where Coupa is a platform where they manage. And let's say Coupa is a folder, for example. Coupa is an app, basically, where they maintain all the contracts we deposited. So think at it from this perspective. There's this customer AppFire. They have at least 60, 70 contracts which are uploaded. All their contracts are being dumped into Coupa. Coupa is directly integrated with Zuri, which means all the contracts will be, by default, picked up here. Now, next cycle onwards, they don't even need to manually upload it. If a new contract gets uploaded into the folder, it is automatically picked up here. And the app owner, or whoever the contract owner is, gets a notification.

>>Gaurav J Chopra	57:06
So even this is a big deal. It looks like we are just doing very minimal. But most of the companies do not even have all contracts in one folder. They do not even have visibility how many contracts. Let's say if certain companies allow VPs to buy certain apps. For example, let's say Sri has bought Zapskill, and he is the only signing authority. Somebody in IT would not even know. So those are the use cases that we're trying to solve here. How they make payment, auto payment, all of that is mostly not our concern. So I'll be sorry, Abhilash, I took it over.

>>Abhilash R	57:34
Abhilash SHARMA No, this is perfect. You got it, no, Dalpati?

>>Dalpati Mandal	57:38
Dalpati Jayashree No, no. Abhilash SHARMA

>>Abhilash R	57:39
Cool. I guess, again, one minute over the time, we'll connect again on how to create this tomorrow. You guys can come up with any questions if you have. So we'll talk about contracts and subscriptions. Purposes, again, you'll understand when you have a contract. So that's an overview of a contract in the license module. We also got to know a bit about vendor module.

>>Vikram Senthil	58:01
Dalpati Jayashree One question, Abhilash, if you don't mind answering. The contracts, with creating contracts, we add that proof of site. Can you explain me the true -ups? I mean, alone, because I wasn't getting it. Abhilash SHARMA True -ups are nothing

>>Abhilash R	58:15
But it's a clause within a contract. Say, for example, you don't have a true -up. You just have signed a contract with Zoom. You purchased 100 licenses. You don't have a true -up clause at all in that contract. So you need to sign up for another new contract to get more licenses, because your contract is just for 100 licenses, user -based licenses. For 100 users, you bought 100 licenses, and that's a contract. If you have a true -up clause, based on your requirement, you can request Zoom to, you can procure more licenses. Say you want 20 more, right? If you have a true -up clause, you can go procure more. That's a true -up clause. Oh, within the same contract, yeah, within the same contract.

>>Vikram Senthil	58:56
Dalpati Jayashree Got it. So I think this concept is there in Slack. Okay, got it.

>>Abhilash R	59:00
Abhilash SHARMA Yeah, it's there in Slack, it's there in Zoom, Google Workspace, and most of the global application, it is there.

>>Vikram Senthil	59:07
Dalpati Jayashree Got it, got it, Yeah. Abhilash Sharma

>>Abhilash R	59:10
Cool, guys, thank you. We'll connect tomorrow again. I've made all one -hour sessions, so we'll connect.

>>Gaurav J Chopra	59:16
Thank you.

>>Shrikaant Iyer	59:17
Dalpati Jayashree Thanks, Abhilash. Abhilash SHARMA Thank you.

>>Abhilash R	59:19
Dalpati Jayashree Thank you.
