>>Aaditi Kulkarni	00:01
I'm calling him a minute one minute I'm at it joining. Okay, I think.

>>subhashis	02:03
Otherwise, I'm not going to do anything that is why you're doing this. No, but now we have it now. I think before sending you show it to me. I suppose she's a specialist.

>>Amithraj AN	02:17
I am with.

>>subhashis	02:19
With the entities. Thank you for joining with me. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

>>Amithraj AN	02:27
How are you?

>>subhashis	02:30
All good. Doing well. Thank you.

>>Amithraj AN	02:33
Yeah. Yeah. So thank you.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	02:39
Yeah. So thank you. We were speaking with Subashish last week about a few items in your income tax return and what should be the treatment of those we just thought that we'll sound you off as well on what position we are taking and what is the rationale behind it etc.

>>subhashis	02:59
Income income tax return for 2324.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	03:05
Fy 2324. Yeah. And so I think you're talking about that the two position right?

>>subhashis	03:10
One is the prior period item and one more is the what is the other one share issuance share issuance.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	03:19
Just give me a second. I call is coming once. Yeah.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	03:43
Yeah. Yeah. Please.

>>subhashis	03:45
We can do anything. Yeah. So the first one is as Subashish mentioned the Esop.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	03:52
So what we understand Shanky is that for the past three years Esop expenses were not being claimed in the books of accounts and consequently in the income tax return and therefore now this year the entire expense which actually also kind of pertains to the last two years.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	04:12
And the current year has been expensed out in the books of accounts and that has been actually okayed by the auditors without much questioning. So the question now was whether to claim this entire expense as a deduction while filing income tax return also because technically for two years the expense would be prior period item and could get disallowed and only the expense for the current year would be allowed. So after discussion with Amit what we suggest is that you can claim the entire expense and I mean it is slightly risky because it might come to the notice of the assessing officer and if that happens at a future date then maybe then we reverse or disallow the two years of expense as prior period, two years is prior period, one year is current year.

>>Amithraj AN	05:16
Okay, got it, here Shanky what we are trying to do here is prior period as Aditi mentioned and you would be aware is not allowed because of the matching concept. Now if this, two ways we are looking at it, one is if it gets detected that probability itself seems to be little low because we are loss making and maybe loss making in the current year also. So one way of looking at it is this may not be coming up, second scenario could be if at all there is why have we claimed now and not in the previous year, one way of looking at it could be that so far it was just the funding what we have done was only one round. See recently there has been more interest in equity and people are now maybe willing to pay tax of up to 36 or 39 % as the case may be to become shareholders. Now we got the confidence that people will possibly exercise this, that is why we have started claiming. That will be the decision where we will take, just giving you, it is not like watertight but in the circumstance Shanky the way I am looking at it is either three options rather, one is I claim deduction only for the current year, second option we claim deduction during the current year for all the three years or the third option that is there which few of the startups are following in the market or industries, you claim only at the time of exercise. Now I do not want a scenario where we claim only at the time of exercise because I run the risk of everything becoming prior period, so therefore the idea was somewhere we take this call instead of going with the third option where every year it becomes an issue going forward.

>>Amithraj AN	07:12
So we go on the basis of this situation where it is a calculated call we are taking, we just want you to be aware that it is not like we are blindly taking this call, it is a position we are trying to take and we have discussed the difference which we can also finish the difference as we go along. If you are okay with it we will go ahead and claim, if you feel let us ignore and Chuck it that also we are fine with that. You are saying this is what we will say to the authority right? That's right, no even prior to that I am asking your feedback also you and Subash's feedback.

>>subhashis	07:48
No, no I am aligned, so we told Guruvan Jana also said the same thing, they said don't take it but what we said is that we want to take it and we can always say that we were going through a very high churn also And we didn't want to take a provision and then do a massive reversal. So we wanted to wait for our head count to stabilize and that's why we are taking it one short. That's only we can prepare whenever if at all the authorities you know. Then in both aspects we can stitch it together if we get there.

>>Amithraj AN	08:29
Sure. Yeah. Perfect. Aditi we are clear now? Yes. Okay.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	08:38
Subashish we are clear right? So we will claim the entire expense in the current year. Yeah, Yeah Aditi.

>>subhashis	08:47
Yeah. It is clear. And you are talking more for the Tp return and all of that calculation right? No. Everywhere. Income tax actually.

>>Amithraj AN	09:00
No, no I know but income tax too Guruvan Jana will file.

>>subhashis	09:03
No, they are just suggesting. Right Aditi? Yes, yes.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	09:09
So Shanky we don't do your return file.

>>subhashis	09:11
We are just basically just providing our thoughts on these No, we only really requested for your feedback, which is fine What I'm just saying is that but TP calculation maybe this will come no Will it not come because this will impact a 3 % all of that calculation now or it won't impact No, because US for people the Rsu cost we take But do we Rsu cost for us we have to cross study to us only now Huh, but it's not those under cost for a gun army, correct? But US got this new course. It started from this for the preliminaries. That's a simple thing. Okay. Okay Then shackle in a time.

>>Amithraj AN	09:55
Oh Because I wish you will be implemented on 1st April Okay, and since we are just on this point of a sub Shankar and So basically what happens is for now, we will claim the fair value as of the date of grant of option or the vesting period And there are two three decisions which have been rendered one in bio con case Bangalore at that one more case open by Mumbai tribunal what net net what they told us today say I've granted the option today The fair value is hundred rupees. I claim hundred or a four -year period Eventually when the shares get exercised or results get exercised rather Price a jumps from hundred to say thousand you will be or you should be entitled for an additional deduction of 900 at that point in time in that year on exercise Tell the differential is correct.

>>subhashis	10:54
I mean and to add on to this one No, I mean you remember the our This one the the exercise we have deferred the exercise period and lead into the liquidating event So Yeah, so that means there is no exercise till the liquidating event. So that's why this particular scenario will not come, right?

>>Amithraj AN	11:17
No, no, what we're trying to say superstition is where at the time of exercise the fair value of the company would have gone up No Okay. So from today to that day, whatever is a Delta I will be able to claim the deduction of that Delta in that year Gordon Gordon.

>>subhashis	11:33
Yeah, perfect. Yeah, exactly Yeah, I'll be back to you

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	11:40
Yeah, so the next issue is on issue of shares at a premium So last year in the fundraise we have issued shares at a 10 % premium to the Fmv Because the investors wanted to keep a 10 % buffer now this happened in July and subsequently in September a Notification came out on this whole 56 to 7 B issue saying that if that buffer is only 10 % Sorry, I mean, could you hear me? Sorry? Yeah, it was disconnect But now it is here,

>>subhashis	12:20
Okay

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	12:21
So basically in July we issued shares at a 10 % Premium to the fair market value itself and in September subsequently a notification came on this 56 to 7 B issue wherein they said that if there is a gap of only 10 % between Fmv and issue price then there will not be any deemed income Implications in the hands of the company under 56 to 7 B Now the question arises is whether we can take the benefit of that notification and apply it Retrospectively to our share issuance, right at that point in time just to clarify when the shares were issued It was aligned between all investors company, etc That the 10 % would be offered to tax and offset against losses But now that we have a notification in place What we are thinking is we will not offer that 10 % buffer to tax and not set it off against losses claiming that the notification is You know just Clarificatory in nature and because it is a beneficial position to the assessing it It will apply retrospectively Got it noted. So if at all it comes up in scrutiny or something or Assessments then this can be a line of argument that we could take Yeah noted

>>subhashis	13:55
Yeah, Amit you have anything to add on this

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	13:58
Yeah,

>>Amithraj AN	13:59
So this again Shankin Subashish, we just hoping Department will apply this circle notification retrospectively and also another thing

>>Amithraj AN	14:10
That is playing in our mind is since it is April 25, this section has been removed. So hopefully we may get a little better treatment also before the department. While technically we do not have a case but it is again like that Esop We are trying our luck.

>>subhashis	14:28
But in this case though we should not exactly luck because the notification that has come in April and also this 10 % does not say whether it is retrospective or not right. But any of these sort of things Shanky is only prospective.

>>Amithraj AN	14:44
No but see when there is a small change

>>subhashis	14:49
Right then we understand it is prospective but something like in April that came which completely abolishes angel tax then it cannot be prospective for this no?

>>Amithraj AN	15:01
No no in the section April sorry in the July 20, 23, 24 budget what came that is very clear the deletion of the section will take effect from April 2024. So it is not a retrospective annulment of the section that is absolutely clear in the law also it is the way that is the way it is. So all the cases whatever have been initiated so far those will run and there will be.

>>subhashis	15:29
See let us say worst case even if you have to reverse this in future there is no interest and all because we are it is just that our set of amount reduces that is it. We any which is have not you know let us say tomorrow we you know right now we increase our you know we basically claim this as losses which means our overall bucket for set of increases and later on authority comes and let us say no why you have done it change it then also there is no penalty or interest because just that our set of amount reduces right there was they would not have any tax.

>>Amithraj AN	16:04
Interest I am with you Shankar There is no interest because there is no outflow that is required. Penalty will come because I have claimed a higher loss than what it was supposed to be but proceeding will start as long as the amendment is justified penalty is calculated on the tax amount only you know there is no tax with or without that amount how can there be penalty?

>>subhashis	16:24
Penalty is always like 1x, 2x you know it is a factor on the tax amount only right that you have evaded or let us say you know not paid. See will you getting me with or without these amounts there is no tax outflow any which ways. So, how will the penalty amount then?

>>Amithraj AN	16:50
How will it get computed as your expense denied into your applicable tax rate that will be the tax that you are short to forego basically. Is it even if I have never made profits?

>>subhashis	17:01
Absolutely.

>>Amithraj AN	17:03
Let us specify KS plus and S actually. Got it.

>>subhashis	17:10
Coming to TP now which is you know also equally time sensitive now how do we you know one is that do we need any further benchmarking or study or this time it is only going to be filing of the return?

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	17:23
So, I spoke to the person who had done your TP filing last year and he said that we will just have a relook at the benchmarks once And then it will largely be filing. So, it will not be a very very detailed benchmarking study like we did last year but a relook will be necessary and to that effect he is also agreed to a 20 % reduction in the fees from last year.

>>subhashis	17:48
I mean what do you mean by so what is the base fee we are talking about? So, last year he had charged 1 lakh this year he is agreed to do it at 80 ,000.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	17:58
And plus the return the fee?

>>subhashis	18:01
No, no. In this 80 ,000 is all inclusive. I mean I think last year should be 1 .5 right? Last year we paid 1 .5. That means TP is definitely. Tp full see last year so basically entire thing got formulated right for the first time.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	18:19
Yeah, so that is why Shanky that some amount was also paid out of that to us because we were also helping to set up this whole structure. No, no. Got it, got it.

>>subhashis	18:31
So, what I am saying is last year 1 lakh was for that study and whatever you also. Study plus returns was 1 lakh.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	18:39
Now it is. 150, yes. No, no. Let me complete once so that you know.

>>subhashis	18:44
Sorry, sorry. So, we paid 1 lakh purely for the study, benchmarking, entire thing and 50K for the return 1 .5 lakhs we paid last year. Now what we are saying is that 1 lakh should not be required as just a reload on that 50 there should be some discount because this year the return will be very simple. So, what this year he is telling is for study, return.

>>Aaditi Kulkarni	19:09
Relooking plus return filing, both of it, he'll combined charge 80 ,000, 150k jat. Yeah, it's very high, Amit.

>>subhashis	19:19
And also, I'll tell you, and purely to just set the context, see, I mean, the business had been extremely slow these two quarters, and we are under a lot of heat from the investors also, not that we have any runway issues as such, but we are under tremendous pressure from the investors to reduce our burn, because we are not growing, Right? So the burn has to be capped to a certain level, which is far -fetched right now. So I've been specifically asked to look at all costs that we are incurring on finance outlays, and at least have one -time reductions, if not perpetual reductions, right? Now, in Tp, and you also know, Amit, how what our entity is, it's not very heavy in terms of transaction volume, complexity, and all of that. So last year, I understand we did everything from the scratch, you know, everything had to be set up. So there, obviously, there's a lot of effort went into. This year, we know that that Relook and all is just a formality. You can just say that we found nothing, and the same assumptions and everything holds true. And then we are just filing a simple return again. My honest, you know, request is that, you know, let's look at the 80s, extremely high. In fact, the 50 also needs to be reduced this year, is what I'm requesting.

>>Amithraj AN	20:36
No, no, both put together, he's saying, instead of 150, it will be 80, is what he's saying. No, no, I can't look at 150 like that.

>>subhashis	20:43
You don't have a requirement of 1 lakh, right? I mean, it's just that if you make a decision in 5 minutes and say, see, I mean, I'm not,

>>Amithraj AN	20:52
No, I'm just wanting to sort of understand what you're comfortable with. So I was just not like, it's not like 1 lakh is not needed at all.

>>subhashis	21:02
And that 50, let's say we do a reduction of to 30k types, 25 -30k. See, I mean, you know that you are a one -stop solution. We have, you know, our monthly returnership is also there, all of it is there, but everything is just simply adding up and our business is very, I honestly tell you where I come from, Duri is like, honestly, a cakewalk. I'm not, let's say, you know, demeaning any kind of work that we all do, but purely from the complexity of the business that we are into and the, you know, volume of transactions that we are into, it's nothing, you know, from that perspective, and Kasim this year has been so bad on Q1, Q2, I'll tell you, Amit, and there's nothing to shy away. You know, Ritish, you know, personally, you have very good rapport with him. So, you know, that we are literally flat two quarters. Our numbers have not grown. We are literally flat. And there's a lot of heat on us, not from a runway perspective, but purely to get our business in shape in terms of board. Right. So, I mean, right now we cannot, you know, we are not in a position to shell out a lot of, you know, external costs. Understood. So, leave it with us.

>>Amithraj AN	22:25
We'll come back with whatever is best possible. And again, Shankyant, any of these things, it's complete pass through, you are only paying directly, etc. So, we have zero economics here. Just negotiate whatever is best possible, we'll get back.

>>subhashis	22:41
Yeah, I trust you completely. You just tell that partner, whoever, I mean, I don't know if Subashish knows the name, but the point is that the way we spoke now, you just, you know, bad on our behalf. You know, you just say that we also agree with the client that this year, the study is hardly, you know, anything. And the return also is going to be just a replica of last year. Very simple. So, you know, let's not, you know, and then maybe next year we can relook at it when our business grows, complexity grows. This agreement change, the simplification will also yield a cost, is it? Simplification of the agreement. So, Aditya, the question to you. Amit is also there now. Last, I mean, we spoke, right, when you were in office personally, that this agreement of to and fro, we need to simplify this to a simple thing that deficit, we do an import invoice. And if there's a surplus, we do an export invoice. Simple agreement, right? Correct, Shanky.

>>Amithraj AN	23:47
That agreement, I don't think will take much time that we will have to do or not, these guys. So, that will be a small amount in them or something. That will not yield a cost or something, right?

>>subhashis	24:00
That's okay.

>>Amithraj AN	24:01
Yeah, okay, cool. Yeah, when can you start the TP1?

>>subhashis	24:08
I mean because we have very little time in the world holidays also this month Yeah, we just reach out to these guys because it's everything is fine.

>>Amithraj AN	24:18
It was only the fee that was spending Sure, let's speak and get back Supershish will be in touch with you Okay Thank you.

>>subhashis	24:28
Thanks Aditi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
