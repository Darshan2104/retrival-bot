>>Rafeeulla Shariff	02:53
Yes. So I'm not able to share my screen.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	02:57
This is only meeting organizers can present. Yeah. Rashmi, you have to give an access because you are the organizer.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	03:10
If you're not able to understand, you can check with the team once.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	03:20
And my how are things going? Good so far.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	03:24
So there's a lot of chaos and we're trying to figure that out. And I think, yeah, the last couple of months have just been structural for me. So, yeah. Good. Good. I agree. I agree. A lot of things are happening in Zuri.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	03:41
Yeah. And yeah. Yeah.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	03:45
We have a lot of stuff going on at the same time. Yeah.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	03:50
But there are so many investors and so many investors will have their own questions. Correct.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	04:00
I mean, September 1 was a little tough for us because we had I'm sure it was tough for you as well. So we had a lot of closings and we had a lot of things going on. There's a quarter end. So, yeah. See, for us, September was tough.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	04:18
October is even more tougher. Is it? Yeah. Because after September, we have to do the filings. In September, we'll be working on forms, documents preparation for the purpose of financials and everything. I'm talking from the perspective of the secretarial team, audit team and all. They will have a hectic schedule in the month of September because due date is September 30th for most of the companies. For us, after the audit is over, after the AGM, there are a lot of things like XBRLs, filing of forms, appointment of auditors.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	04:52
Panel returns lot of things will be there Yeah

>>tanmayi (Guest)	04:57
And Mca is not working properly now you got an access

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	05:02
Yes

>>Rashmi Gupta Agarwal	05:06
So Yeah

>>tanmayi (Guest)	05:06
I think you're able to see my screen Right Yes yes

>>Rashmi Gupta Agarwal	05:13
Yes okay

>>tanmayi (Guest)	05:14
So from 20 to 23 onwards is when we're going to and we'll need everything sort of from from Guru and Jain especially right So Yeah 23 onwards I tried to what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make documents accessible easily accessible for ours ourselves and for you As well so Yeah So I can I put I try and put down the links for all of this But there are some documents that we still do not have like for example I realized today that we didn't have the documents of this meeting at all like this meet the eighth board meeting that happened in financial year 22 23 we don't have any documents for that meeting it's it's surprising And I don't know why that's one thing um same thing with 23 24 as well we do not have a lot of documents here and there we have like a couple of issues there So Snc's so mostly we do not get the Snc's when we actually ask the investors to send them and or we don't get it on time and we don't fight on and we don't keep a track of it or whatever So I want to know what the consequences of this are so how does it go if we do not have the Snc's because I realize that there are very old Snc's that we do not have at all so will there be any repercussions or I don't know Yeah So I think I'll take this question

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	06:48
But I want Subhashish also to be part of this discussion so that he will also have clarity

>>tanmayi (Guest)	07:00
Yeah Okay So that's one thing that then I think we keep us that question pending And then you can answer that when he's here Right Yeah That's one thing and a couple of other things in the in the meanwhile As well So I think so when we're preparing the Ctc's I think Rashmi has answered this question to me earlier as well preparing the Ctc's for anything we will need to do it so what's happening is last time when we were filing for Nsdl and CDSL and everything we had this issue of not having the Ctc's for most of it So what I thought was I mean because I didn't understand the fact that we had to prepare it only when when it was needed so I was like Okay we don't have it suddenly And we have to file it to them probably in a day or two and it was very last moment for us to sit down on that and start preparing those Ctc's so is there an alternate of it can we just keep the drafts of all of it and then probably cut only the parts that we need and put it Or I don't know how you'd suggest an alternative for that Yes also I made note of this whatever queries you have I'm just making note once Subhashish comes we can just quickly discuss on all the points so that everyone will be on the same page and this so another thing so for this year we had another board meeting So I didn't join by then and I was not able to find the information for that as well so we had a second board meeting between April 4th and September I don't know when the board meeting was we do not have any documents for that As well so Yeah This is one thing that's something I want to clarify from your side.

>>Rashmi Gupta Agarwal	08:45
Tell me one thing I would like to mention here see second board meeting right? Second board meeting documents Yes so it was for EGF like I mean to say for increasing that one person sentence for is self -related right to increase the pool so for that we have already Yes so you people are marked there whatever draft we have sent to the investors you are always marked there for the see I don't know about earlier one because I was not handing But yes subsequent that we have already shared those document and you Priya, Subhashish, everyone is marked there. However, signed documents we have to receive from all of them because what happens here is like same documents are circulated to you know many directors And we have to coordinate with their CST for that signed document so that is pending.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	09:40
We do have the documents for board meeting too right? Yes, the drafts are there. Because it's not part of our repository and I was looking at it I was like how come

>>tanmayi (Guest)	09:51
How is it that we don't have it? So yeah, that's one thing if you have And then then sort of share it across to us We'll save it up and that's good But that's one thing and another thing was so when we're having a physical copy of the documents when we're saving these documents Having a soft copy and having a physical copy. I think these are two things that are separate. So from a secretarial perspective when is it is it better for us to Maintain the physical copies of all the documents or just keep soft copies of all the documents because I heard things like we have to Keep it with the Roc And I don't know. It's it's very jumbled Opinions there so that that was one of my questions as well.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	10:40
Yeah, I'm not at this point also I'm just making note of all the questions Right.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	11:02
And so yeah, this is about the board meetings and for Egm and AGM I have tried to make something similar as well. This is still in progress. I am going to be done with this In about a day or two and Rashmi this week. I'll share this with you as well If you could help me out with some of the documents that are missing here as well I'm sure all of them are not there So if you can help me with that, that will be good again

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	11:38
My order Yes, you know so other points you can just Not know today.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	11:46
I'll just check if they are done. What do they are just one second?

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	11:51
Okay I Miss me

>>tanmayi (Guest)	12:42
Yes, yes Hey Subash is Shanky's also here, right? Hey Shanky, I think I'm seeing you first time. Yeah

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	13:02
So you returned recent days and Shanky So I should pronounce your name as Shanky, right or any other Okay, nice to meet you But I had been to Zuri couple of times I think two times had been So I was able to only meet Tanmay once and Subash's twice Maybe you would have come last week. No, I believe just July first week Anyways nice to meet you Shanky I was just seeing some mails which were not Kind of there were some issues and everything So Usually what we do is Wherever there are a lot of things are happening in the clients We do a weekly meeting Rashmi Gupta. You can just move to yourself. Whenever you're talking in and move to yourself There is some construction work going on in our office. We're expanding So probably Yeah, probably we'll just invite you next one. There is an aggression So it's construction work is almost completed. There are some I think interiors and all is going on will formally invite you shortly So I thought I'll just usually what we do is whenever there's a lot of works are happening We do a weekly meeting or at least once in two weeks or once in a month meeting will help to understand better Because most of the issues will happen only because of communication gap. We would have assumed something and As per our record something will be there as per your records something is not matching or whatever it is

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	14:50
So before you join the call Tanmay has had some question. So queries and she has already told those queries. I thought I'll just wait for you also together. We can take those queries and explain so that all of them will be in the same page, right? Yeah, so first question query what Tanmay had was the Snc. Some of the SNCs are not available. What do we do? How it works? So usually what will happen is. For any meeting which is happening. There is a need for short notice consent whenever there is a short notice meeting example for a shareholders meeting 21 days And it is as required to be given 21 clear days notice has to be given. For a board meeting or as per the Aoa whatever is the higher number Aoa cannot prescribe less than 21 days. They can prescribe higher than 21 days, right? Same way for board meeting also 7 days notice is required to be given. If it is below 7 days, then short notice consents are required. How it works is example AGM is a shareholders meeting is being proposed on Monday. Today is a board meeting short notice. We're sending the notice before Monday is a Monday. We need to get a short notice consent. If you're not getting the short notice consent meeting cannot be convened at all. So if it is convened without obtaining the short notice consent that is a non -compliance as per law minimum short notice consent is 95 % that is what law says or if the article says that so And so investor is required and everything mandatorily that is that will become mandatory even if they are holding lesser than 5 % overall right that will become mandatory.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	16:41
So in Zuri says what is happening is there are many investors and investors have their own legal team or secretary team and some of the things which is happening in Zuri will be on urgent basis or they cannot give it proper notice of 21 days. So wherever meetings has been done at the end some short notice has not been received. We have to follow up with them and get the short notice consent. There is no other option. We cannot say no short notice is not received. If we are saying short notice is not received then the meeting itself is not valid. So before this what I want to convey is see overall as per our understanding Zuri is doing better compliances. There is no doubt in that. In fact, some of the companies don't even conduct the board meetings don't even conduct the shareholders meeting. They only show in records. They've conducted the meeting and they'll proceed with filings. But since Zuri is a little large corporate and they have a better kind of finance team and secretary team they comply with all the compliances of the law. These whatever short notice consents and whatever other documents are there. These are internet documents until unless there is some scrutiny or there is some Ddr happening in the company until then it is only internet documents. So that is one to answer Tanmay's question. Tanmay we need to obtain short notice consent. If it is not available, we need to follow up with them and get it. We need to get that short notice consent. There is no other option. So how do we get how to tackle that?

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	18:23
We can discuss that separately but to answer your question it is mandatory short notice consents from the investors. Second what Tanmay had question was Ctc whether it is required for all the board meetings all the shareholders meeting Ctc is a certified true copy of extracts of the minutes, which is not mandatory for all the matters until unless there is something which is required to be submitted to any authorities and any other person. Example we appoint we do a MOA alteration or Aoa alteration. We need to extract to be attached in the form which is being filed with department Roc. Then Ctc will become mandatory because we cannot give whole minutes of the meeting to the department. So having said that apart from these matters example if investors wants any CTCs or any other person department one CTCs might be Gsc department or whatever it is. Then Ctc will be required only for providing to them. But it is not mandatory for a company to have a Ctc for all the agenda items which is being passed.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	19:30
So tomorrow if someone needs it, how do we then have that Ctc?

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	19:34
Ctc can be signed anytime by any of the example now you want a Ctc of previous year, right? So it is not.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	19:49
Not necessary that you have to sign the Ctc backdated last year only, Ctc is nothing but it is a extract of the minutes certified by the director saying that this is a this we have extracted from minutes of the meeting understood right, we are getting some request last minute like for Nsd or CDSL or some of our investors are just asking us for Ctc of certain board meetings, so what I think is it is better for us to have the like you said certain agendas we will need CTCs, so I have in the tracker that I sent you, you have the list of agendas for all the board meetings, if we can identify what are the agendas that we might need a Ctc, we can keep those CTCs ready, whenever somebody needs it.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	20:38
Those things will be anyways it will be available, example now when there is agenda item for Aoa alteration, example in this matter only if you see there is agenda item for in your screen what you have shared with us now, there is agenda item for the purpose of to approve the offer and issuance of so and so matter in the AGM 20th of June 2023 Right, this Ctc is already filed with Nc website, no No I was just referring to other one, so example now you can Yeah 20th example, I am just taking one example AGM 3 28th June to issue offer let an issuance of so many shares right, for this already Mgt 14 one form is required to file which is already filed for which attachment is mandatory Ctc that is already available, which were mandatory CTCs it will be already available in the company because it is already filed with departments right, example now next agenda item also if you see appointment of Mr. Devdosh Kumar as a director as a non -executive director of the company, so since this was appointed as a non -executive director of the company and again second agenda item also recently articles, there is a need for filing couple of forms for this example, first agenda item there is a need for filing Dir 12, second agenda item there is a need for filing Mgt 14, in those forms Ctc is mandatory, so that will be anyways available, considering that our repository from 2022 onwards must be properly kept and something that we are revising currently, so we just want to be sure in all ways that we have all the Ctc, I am not saying that we are not going to have it, we may we may not have it

>>tanmayi (Guest)	22:24
And we have filed, So I mean as you mentioned Rafi that whatever once you are yourself saying that some of these need a Ctc, only for those at least let us keep it ready now, and see you just need to identify we can only take it signatures from, just tell us which ones we need, rest we can only take because the address is with us only, it is already available, it is already available, it is there in the forms, anyways that we will see and pull out,

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	22:56
Yes Subhashish you were telling something, yeah,

>>tanmayi (Guest)	23:00
So what I am saying is if at all say for example last year the thing approved board meeting, Ctc we named out right, so if we have the word file available with us right, we can take those particular extract and put it in the paper and sign it and use it right, so that is why when we are keeping a repository or we can get it from Rasmi also that no, the repository should have both the sign copy and also the word copy, so that we can use it anytime, because creating cities for each and every agenda is not a like, only the ones we think we need might be needed, which generally are needed, so that is why we need to have a repository, so that we can use it, so that is why we need to have a repository, so that we can use it, and we can use it any time, whenever required we have already provided.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	24:29
Whatever is mandatory, it should be already signed, the reason being is some form would have been filed for those mandatory items, right? The Ctc would have been already been signed and kept it in records. There is no doubt in that. Because example now Aoa is there. Ct is mandatory attachment in the form that is already filed. That is what.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	24:48
We have also shared. So next question what Tanmay had before he joined was whether all the documents need to be kept in the soft copies or hard copies are also mandatory. In fact when I had visited Suri we had a very detailed meeting with Subhashish and team. So we had clearly mentioned that minutes of the meeting are permanent documents of the company which is required to be kept in the company in hard copies. So soft copy also is doable having said but it should be timestamped. So what the law says is if you see even digital act came in 2002 which gave a permission for company to keep documents in digital format that is doable having said that digital documents needs to be timestamped which is not practically possible in Suri's case which is what I feel timestamped is nothing but Dac is referred to a fixed it should be kept in the server that server details are required to be given to Roc when we are filing the forms with Roc when we are filing there is an option wherein we need to select where the documents are kept the address details and everything has to be given. So and considering the nature of company and lot of documentation everything and some document most of the documents are in hard copies we need to have a scan copy for having a handy documents and having a track of all the things that hard copies are required to be kept in the company 100 % there is no doubt in that. So you had another question about that Ajm document something I did not get anything by the time Subhashish had come you were asking something else as well.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	26:39
Yeah, so for the Ajm and Egm if yeah for the Ajm and Egm I have also made another sheet so it is easier for us to understand I think I said I'm not I've not completed that yet. So yeah, I'll send this across to Rashmi again and then I'll ask her to send me the documents that I might need as part of this as well because we have not spoken about that till now. So yeah, I think accordingly we will follow up with her And we should be done with this exercise in a week or two maximum I think right Yeah

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	27:16
So Tanmay with due respect to your request in one week two weeks it is not practically possible two reasons to it whenever we have done a documentation we have already sent it to the company without sending it to company we will not get a signed copy that is one thing already we have sent multiple times as well documents second thing is now as I said you before I think Subhashish came this is the peak time for us wherein we have to file the returns of the company for almost for all the companies after the AJM September usually in a whole year September and October will be a very peak season for us in fact I can say mid till mid end of November also it will be too hectic schedule for us because lot of all the companies we need to do the XBRLs we need to file the annual returns savers report auditors appointment and almost all the compliances will happen in this year in this period right and in since we have already sent it to the company multiple times just pulling out and giving can be done there is no doubt in that But right now considering the time required for all these things again pulling out from our server because what will happen is if Rashmi Ranjan is working on one assignment she will be given access from office only for that particular assignment we will not give to all the assignments access to her because of confidentiality and Nda which we have with clients right so for every old document we need to go back and take confirmation from the IT team and all those internal processes it will take some time so that is for not only for Zuri for any clients anything is required there is a process at office since ours is a little larger setup and we work in a little more organized way for all the clients

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	29:04
Right so wherever you want help specifically definitely will help you but giving all the documents from last few years a few months we have a lot of documents last two years so this is the EGMs and AGMs

>>tanmayi (Guest)	29:22
No no so for the time being 2023 -2024 please keep it aside Okay okay But because since audit is already over right only thing is whatever is required that's once their tough period is over then we can do this you can keep it aside for the time being

>>tanmayi (Guest)	29:47
But for the time being, no, at least we'll create the 24 -25, right, which is on top priority, because once we'll move on to like November or December, then if we go back to investor, right, they will ask us why it is past due. So so that's why, you know, we need to follow up with them and get it done now 24 -25. So we mostly have all the documents, maybe a few of them. We may not have those we might need from 24 -25. You have the tracker. 24 -25. Yes. So I have. That you can share with her. I believe she has said. This is the tracker that I shared with them. So, yeah, Yeah. I think a couple of we might have mostly. Some we may not. But the tracker, I believe Rasmi has said you need to. Yeah, I need to look into that. That's right. So sorry, I mean, do you agree to this?

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	30:56
So, Subashish, we have already sent those tracker. I think Rashmi Gupta wanted to say something. Yes, Rashmi.

>>Rashmi Gupta Agarwal	31:03
Now, yes, this just a few days ago have sent one tracker where it is just giving the clear picture of what all documents we have received for EGM02 and AGM. And as I have mentioned that for Egm01 was already sent that closer tracker was already sent, because at the end of the quarter, we definitely share to all our clients the closer tracker. But for this board meeting, like what happened this EGM02 that will be the tracker of that will be sharing soon. No, no.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	31:36
Few documents are missing. That's why we are saying so. So, Subashish, I agree with you.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	31:42
For 24 -25, you want updated tracker that can be doable because we will have clarity about that. See, what is happening now is there are dozens of mails which is being exchanged between Zuri and Gurujana, wherein in midst of so many mails, some of the things which we've already sent it to you, you are not keeping track of some request which you are making it to us. Somewhere in midst of so many mails, we would have missed replying to your mails. Having said that, I think this is a weekly meeting, a biweekly meetings if you do for a few days, a few weeks at least. It will help to streamline the things. Sure.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	32:21
See, after October, probably we'll just visit your office also once.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	32:27
So that we can just verify the documents, hard copies there, and we can sit and discuss in detail on all the pending matters as well. Sure, done, done.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	32:38
And Rashmi, on that day also, you know, continuation of our discussion through phone, telephonic conversation, we have to do the follow up. So since few documents, we have seen that you did follow up and you sent the document to the investors. But after that, follow up is missing, because of which, when I talk to them, they're saying, if you send now, I will sign and send you. So I am talking about the Kalari team. Right. So same way, you can instruct to your team also. Same thing that if they will send one document, right. And the follow up should be gone right after two days, immediately. So each day, second follow up, then we should phone, call. So if you don't have contact, you can update us. We'll call and update, definitely. Or I will send you the contact also.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	33:36
So, Subhashish, this is doable, 100 % no doubt on that. We do respect your request. We can do this. But having said that, this is not, as I told you many times, this is not part of our engagement. See, I'll tell you one thing. We handle many clients, right. Hundreds of clients we handle. So I have a team of almost some 65 members who works with us on only secretary matters. And we handle hundreds of clients. And we have expertise in all these matters. There is no doubt at all. And for the work involved, what pieces we charge, based on the work, what is given by client to us. And we need to quantify the work as well. How much work is there and what is the cost to us and everything. So that is very important. Yes, one request was there, orally and all. Orally, first of all, you can say orally you have told something. I can tell only a few things we have told. What is in writing, that matters a lot. That is one thing. Second thing is, in writing also, in orally also, I have already told many a times as well. This cannot be done as a request for everything because follow ups and all, though it looks.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	34:47
Keeping a track and following up is not a practical. Practically it is very very time consuming And it requires lot of tracking things and everything right So so keeping that in mind I'll have a separate discussion on this with you because if you want us to follow up definitely will do it. I'll put one more person to follow up because Rashmi Gupta is a very senior most person in my team and she has many other clients also I can put one more person as well on Suri. And there is a cost involved for that and there will be extra extra fees for that for sure without that 100 % we cannot follow up that I am very much clear about this process Right so you have we will discuss separately on this.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	35:30
What we can do know so as a midway see one is either we should get to know that so many people have not replied right see right now what is happening is that that if you don't even know the status of non replies or non acceptances then how do we also follow up so what we can then do Is that Okay I understand you need a separate person and right now we are not in a position to incur honestly any extra costs because you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we are not in a position to incur honestly any extra costs because you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we are not in a position to incur honestly any extra costs because you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we are not in a position to incur honestly any extra costs because you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we are not in a position to incur honestly any extra costs because you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we you know we are looking at how do we reduce cost because our business is right we are not in position to incur honestly any extra costs because of you know we are only going to incur that kind of waste then this we are trying to give you really fast bid fast so let me give you a different iteration of this software which is very very nice which I doing 3 -4 emails our one call will work but at least knowing the status real -time if that was it because that for tracking at least you will have to help us because once you have sent a notice or a circular resolution or anything we at least need to know who all have at least replied so that we don't unnecessarily follow up with them so that visibility you can create on a central file that every new transaction that happens it gets added to that file along with the people who have responded yes yes Yes then we know only No No No we have to follow only those people at least create that visibility which will not need an additional person and also help us not incur any extra cost and we will be able to follow I think this is very clear for us so partially agreed but what we can do is

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	37:14
Process -wise We will prepare the documents and send it to Tanmay And Subhashish and will mark you as well so Tanmay can just send the mails to them so that she'll have a track now what will happen is now we sending it to them then Tanmay again we are just checking who is sent who is not sent you are already keeping us in Cc so we get to know but who is supposed to main that tracking tracker also that who has replied and was not the mandatory part 75 % 95 % 90 % reply has come or not you want us to maintain that tracking also that percentage tracking and you know that is necessary for things to be approved as a circular resolution or let's say board board meeting to be successfully conducted or a SCN to be Snc sorry to be that is a major part of work it's not like see it's not like we don't want to do for Zuri that is a major job say example if I I want to know example if there are only two shareholders I'm not bothered

>>tanmayi (Guest)	38:18
I'm not worried because only there are two shareholders two directors it's very easy for us to track the things if there are some multiple dozens of shareholders and multiple directors what will happen is tracking itself is a bigger task in the company right that only will take a lot of time and efforts most cases in most cases 4 people are required and net 4 is countable 2 or 3 are in our company only okay 3 of our founders are 3 directors I mean 3 board members all of that so worst case we need to external people to track So I'm just saying is that see if if you say that only sending an email of preparing I mean then honestly then you tell us that everything is half done half not done then it's better we do it ourselves only then it's becoming that kind of a case that I'm carrying a hump these person carrying a Charlie person carrying a buggy so then there's no transaction which is 100 % completed everything is half -baked somewhere we have to see I

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	39:17
Totally I totally agree with your thoughts on this matter I don't deny it's not I see we cannot say you see there are this year there are a lot of meetings lot of AGMs then only there are so many issues are happening right so going forward if that not too many meetings not too many AGMs and AGMs then this issue can be rectified or solved to a greater extent that is one thing second thing is I am NOT telling

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	39:45
That I'll do only 30 % 40 % see what is our role the preparation of documents and can sending to client that is 100 % job is completed is not only 30 40 % that is a main task coordination for sending the documents and getting the signed documents.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	40:00
So my point I don't think that is 100 % because ultimately compliance is a joint task that if you have sent something and the percentage required for that transaction is not over then just sending is not just the transaction right the entire transaction is sending and getting the required percentage confirmation. I agree.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	40:23
So we cannot take it for sending is my job taking the information is yours tracking is also yours.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	40:31
No, no, no. I'll tell you. I can help you. Where I can help you is he Shanky following up is a very tedious task. He can time -consuming, you know, so many people you have to again keep on following up and there's no end to it because what if they don't reply after 10 follow -ups also, right? So I can take away the follow -up part from you. But sending and tracking these two which is purely by email, it goes into your tracker doesn't need manual too much of time only for reply comes someone is see whoever is hearing their email. They just need to put that update in the tracker. So no bandwidth gone the main bandwidth is going in follow -up I agree with you that we can take up but sending plus whenever a reply comes making sure it goes in our Excel or Google tracker or something so that we know that this replies are that percentage replies we are we are done with this over now, let's say after 75 we get three more, you know, people replying don't need to update we need to only update up till the minimum compliance required after that we are getting 20 more confirmations we don't need to track. We just need to track whether the minimum compliance is done or not. And for that just someone clearing the email updating in the tracker is important that's it following up what we will do because we will know 75 % is not done we will get into following up and you will automatically get a reply you don't even need to get into you know tracking that email or follow -up email you just need to track the their reply email with confirmation that's it and updating a tracker so understood your concern let me just recheck with our QC team also about this matter

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	42:14
So how do we just take it forward see we never say no to any of the clients work I totally appreciate the way you are you want to keep a track if I am shanky I will also do the same thing so there is no second thought of it So we will definitely help you in whatever it is required it just that the amount of time which my team is spending on this Zuri works I When I when I thought I sat with the review with Rashmi Gupta another member also who was involved in Zuri but earlier also there was one more man member who was involved the amount of time what we have spent on Zuri and the cost what is involved for the time invested is much more and beyond the breakeven I cannot even say breakeven Okay

>>tanmayi (Guest)	43:01
So he has a professional form I want to have a central discussion see I will tell you I mean if you look at Guru and Jana as a relation as one vendor policy right now what is happening now for certain parts you are discussing for audit someone else is discussing right now we'll do income tax filing then there are any secretarial work related to fund fundraising each item is you know charged at 25 ,000 30 ,000 35 ,000 you know that is also secretarial work only right any any new work other than your day -to -day Work there's a separate charge to it yes or no right every single item has an extra charge beyond the day -to -day activities with respect to a board meeting or a circuit resolution now we cannot say we when we look at a client we cannot look at a client key by I will look at a retainership as a single you know cost to you know effort ratio I will look at fundraising into documents cost to effort ratio separately I will look at you know income tax filing separately I will look at audit separately I will look at this separately everything if you look at separately we have only one P &l so see you have to understand you have to look as Lohri as one client and how much Guru and Jana is charging from all pods altogether how much yearly how much amount got built and is that commensurate or not see if every year I am giving you ad hoc activities with respect to fundraising changes in article or changes in that let's say any other you know important work ultimately that is taking care of the overall effort Right I mean I need to come and meet I need to come and meet Shanky I need to learn too many things from Shanky

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	44:45
From finance matter. Thank you. It's a compliment.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	44:54
I agree with you. I don't deny.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	44:57
See, I say usually to trust me. I don't talk to clients in so detail about the commercials and all this matters because the amount of time now what we are spending on this discussion, the opportunity cost of this time is much more than what we are discussing right now. I don't get involved in all this only because there are so many issues. I thought I'll just discuss about this matter and close this group.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	45:23
I understand completely and I agree with you. It's better to have one -on -one discussion rather than have too many emails.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	45:53
I will try and it's already before this call. I already had a discussion with Hina who is an audit partner. So we keep discussing. I am in Gurujana from last 13 years. I work as a director at Gurujana. So I have a very good. In fact, I am part of management team at Gurujana, right? So we discuss in all these matters wherever escalations happen, be it smaller or bigger. It is escalation to us because usually out of 100 clients example, I'm handling 100 clients, not even 2 % of clients escalate to us. Almost all the clients are happy. It's escalations wherever it comes, even a small one or bigger one. I need to look into that seriously and close it, right? But having said this, this call was very much needed and helpful for me. So let the pending things get over. We will help you to the best possible way and tracking the things. I'll directly get involved in.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	47:01
They will focus more on the recency of the compliances, right? So I get delayed in completing, but we are progressing towards the, you know, you know, last come first, what are, you know, lethal basis that, you know, whatever has last happened. We are 100 % compliant on all confirmations, percentages, requirements. Then we are in a good state because honestly, we will again go for a fundraise. There'll be again from you only. Your time will be saved when we are 100 % compliant, right? So anyways, I think this is helpful.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	47:35
We will go backwards. Whatever is done now. Recently, those things will just keep a track and other things will also just give in. We'll have a separate meeting on every probably next week. Also, I want to not next week might be if you give time to me till first week of November. It will be a great help because in this month and I have too many. In fact, just for information, we're working on Saturdays and days and we're working on Friday.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	48:03
We're going to home in the midnights. Because seven or eight, nine months in a year, people work on Saturdays and days.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	48:15
No, it is now compared to earlier. It's very tough nowadays to convince the members working with us to work on Saturdays and days earlier. It was even though we were not. We used to not tell them numbers. They used to voluntarily work because work demands now until unless it's very much important and we are demanding now. It's not like earlier. So anyways, I think the great talking to you and we'll come and meet you sometime next month. I'll talk to you separately. I'll discuss with you about your time convenient time next month. I will meet once again. We will keep a track of we will support you. I don't want to see from the perspective of only what we are earning out of this because earlier also told this to Subhashish because the way we are working. We have been working with Subhashish before funding or during funding or after funding. We don't work or talk like a clients. Usually when we talk, we talk as a friends. So professionalism is there. But at the same time, we talk as a friends. So that that is what we have a rapport with Subhashish. Anyways, we will keep a track on all the pending things and we'll have organized way and wherever possible. We will not try to increase the fees or whatever it is, but we'll do a match.

>>Rafeeulla Shariff	49:43
I will check with our QC team also and then get back to you in case if you need any support from your side.

>>tanmayi (Guest)	49:49
