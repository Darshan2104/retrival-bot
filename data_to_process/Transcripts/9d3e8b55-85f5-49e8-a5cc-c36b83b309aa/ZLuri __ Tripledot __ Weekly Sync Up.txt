>>Dmitry Tabolich	00:00
I will just check with Estetva in the meantime, just give me a second, please. I think he's a little under the weather, but he will be joining, he will be joining. Yeah, because I have a couple of questions, but it's more of a technical question. And maybe, maybe, yeah, we can wait for him, but after one week, not this week, but after another week, I think Kazeka asked if we can make some presentation for him, because, oh, let's discuss it with Estetva. Yeah, absolutely.

>>Anupam Acharya	00:35
Yes, Estetva.

>>Astitva Gajendra	00:39
One second, I have, I have,

>>Dmitry Tabolich	00:41
Yeah, I have some, yeah, smart camera.

>>Anupam Acharya	00:44
That is a very fancy camera you have there.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	00:46
Yeah, you know, guys, I spent 200 euros to buy this camera because my laptop camera cannot show how handsome am I. No, no, I'm sure it always does. And also I can do like this one also, you know, like it's working like this one. Oh, wow.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:08
What camera is this? I need to get one of these too.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	01:12
I can send, I mean, maybe you'll see.

>>Astitva Gajendra	01:17
Unfortunately, you're not as handsome as Dima. Okay, so let that happen.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	01:21
I am not.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:22
I think I want to do something like this. You know, this is very exciting. Yeah.

>>Astitva Gajendra	01:27
Do like this one.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	01:30
I mean, you know, you know, I just changed gesture because last time it was like this one. And it was funny because I'm trying to show something like this, you know. Exactly. Exactly.

>>Anupam Acharya	01:49
This is so much better. Yeah. Yeah.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	01:51
I had a conversation with someone and I told him.

>>Astitva Gajendra	01:57
Imagine how your meeting with Alex would be like.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	02:02
Alex, everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Okay. Probably about camera. Just with this chat. Maybe you can check it later.

>>Anupam Acharya	02:16
Oh, amazing. Amazing. That's very helpful. Thanks, Dima. I'm going to buy one of those.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	02:22
You can. You can. Yeah. But yes, it's really nice.

>>Anupam Acharya	02:26
Amazing.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	02:26
Quite expensive, but nice. I mean, like camera is cost around 200. It's quite expensive. But it's tiny too. It's light version. There is some just tiny tool. It's not light. It has more gesture if you need it. Got it.

>>Anupam Acharya	02:43
Absolutely.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	02:44
That's very helpful. First one. Are you here? Yes.

>>Astitva Gajendra	02:50
Yeah.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	02:53
Nice. Next week. Let's check our calendar. Not next week. After next week. Maybe let's make all. Let me just check calendar. Calendar. Alex Kajeko. Alex Kajeko. Next week Alex already will be busy. His calendar already reviewed. But maybe we can call. Make call next. Not text. 23. October or 24. Yes. And maybe I can show you detail.

>>Astitva Gajendra	03:38
Sure. Yeah. 23rd or 24th. Okay. So if we schedule it on 23rd. Will the same.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	03:48
But about the same calls right now. No. I just check his. I just check his calendar right now.

>>Astitva Gajendra	03:56
Maybe we can do it.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	03:57
Maybe we can move it. For example. One second. Let me check. So in my location right now. It's from 3. 15 to 4 p .m. But maybe we can move it to. From 4 p .m. To. 3 .30. 4 .30. Sorry.

>>Astitva Gajendra	04:18
3 .30 to 4 .30. And that's GMT plus 2 hours 30. No.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	04:23
In my location. It's from 4 p .m. To 4 .30.

>>Astitva Gajendra	04:28
From 4 to 4 .30. Okay. And again. Just coming. That's GMT plus 2 hours 30 minutes. Right. Yes. 3 hours. We live from us. So when you say 4. 4 to 4 .30. It would be 7 to 7 .30. So yeah. It will coincide with our time. On 23rd. Correct.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	04:49
Sure. Yes. Yes. We also have called this in Wednesday. But we have it from. 15 to 4 p .m.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	04:58
But right now, we can put from 4 PM to evaluation, to force purchase.

>>Astitva Gajendra	05:04
Just after this call, you mean, like, whatever the time that suits, right? Yeah, Anupam, how does your schedule looks like? Is this for Qbr with Alex?

>>Anupam Acharya	05:13
It looks good. It looks good.

>>Astitva Gajendra	05:15
So let's confirm this for 23rd at 4 PM your time, Dima. Yeah. For the time being, if that timing is what you are also saying, feel free to add Alex. Otherwise, you can suggest me, propose me a new time on the same calendar.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	05:34
Oh, OK.

>>Astitva Gajendra	05:36
Yeah, I can propose this call.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	05:39
Yeah, let's do it. Yes, but next week, we'll have a global summit in our company, and Alex will be quite busy. This week, I checked already. The calendar, it's overloaded already. We need to do it before, you know, one week usually. But in 23 October, I can find some window. And also, I can find some window on 24th. It's Thursday. But not in this time. Maybe a little early. I mean, it's early for us, but not for you. We can discuss it, but let's maybe do it after this call.

>>Astitva Gajendra	06:16
Sure, sure.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	06:17
Yeah, because if we don't do it after this call, I have a feeling that next time, we can surely make it only maybe in November. But it's, I think, better to do it, yes, in 23 or 24. Ok, yeah, I think we can start.

>>Astitva Gajendra	06:35
Yeah, yeah, Yeah, we can. We can start from one issue.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	06:38
You know about what I want to ask you, probably.

>>Astitva Gajendra	06:42
So we did do a debugging, Dima. So we identified that at the time when this rule was triggered. And we checked it for the user, the same user whom we had checked on this, like Giovanni, correct? So for Giovanni, we checked it. And we identified that at the time when it was triggered, the first condition that was basically, I guess, the site ID, right, Madhu? That was not qualifying. And it was only after when the user was ingested into Zuluri, or rather, after Mark for onboarding, was when the site ID appeared in the logs. So just wanted to confirm if that's the case. Yeah, Madhu, if you want to add something else, please go ahead.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	07:38
Yes, Heidi Marfest, first of all, has been a long time that we met. Good to see you on the front camera. You usually are on the side view of, yeah.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	07:48
Thank you. So, you know, I also can be like Apple right now.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	07:54
I can present, I can show like this, and also. Needless to say, you're OK.

>>Astitva Gajendra	08:01
Yeah, it's very funny, yes.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	08:03
You know, it's like, Madhu, I want to tell you something, you know, like, yeah, OK.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	08:09
Oh, great, that's great.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	08:11
One second, I tried to return it back, yes. Ok, we can continue.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	08:16
Perfect. Yeah, so summarizing what Astitva just said, right. So the automation rule actually got triggered. But when it got triggered, it goes through sequentially, right. It checks the first condition. And if it qualifies, it goes to the second condition. And if all the conditions that are going through, and then it executes the playbook. So it got triggered, checked the first condition. At the time of the trigger for this user, the site ID was not present. It was not updated to be Jakarta. And you know, it fails there. So for any user that's marked for onboarding, we check all the existing automation rules. And if only the conditions go through, then the playbooks get executed. And we see a workflow in the run log. So at the time of this trigger, this user, and also, likely, the other three users that you quoted did not have the site ID information available. So the first condition fails there. And it did not go through the execution.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	09:15
That was - One second, it looks a little strange, because, okay.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	09:22
I just want to - Is there a way for you to check when the site ID is updated?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	09:27
Yeah, look at it. I just want to clarify it with you, because, let me just jump to Doogie, and I will show you again. Because we spent some time with Asti about this one, but I have a feeling maybe, probably, to fix it, I also should show it to you. Look, when someone identified in Doogie, for example, and marked for onboarding, we have a guy - Okay, let's find someone more. Okay.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	09:57
Can you see my screen, yes?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	09:59
Yes. Okay.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	10:01
We have Skype will be started working only next year, in January, as you see, it's already. If I jump to his account, you can find that each time I can find his site ID. It's meaning that it will be like Barcelona and et cetera. It was the same for all this user. Regarding our automation, for example, let me just press it here. Okay. Never mind. Let me press this here. He was from Barcelona and we have here automation. I just want to again, check it. For example, we have first automation, it will be about creating Google account. Okay. Barcelona. We have this playbook. Let me just press it here, for example. It just creates a Google account. Yes. The password, nothing special. We already have automation. If I go to automation rules, let's just wait on Barcelona. Barcelona. Look, we have this automation. Yes. We have Twigger, it's active. Oh no, this one. We have Twigger, it's active. Google Workspace Barcelona, it's already active. If I press edit, we have here some condition. Main Twigger is if you're using market forward loading, then site equals Barcelona, you can... Okay. Let's jump here. Yes. Someone jump just. Okay. Yes. No, no. He's still here. Yes. He's still here. I just check it here. No, everything is fine.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	11:41
Yes. Right now, we just want to instigate issue. Market forward loading. Wow. I just wanted to put across. So the thing here is that we acknowledge that the site ID is present and the values are matching what you had mentioned.

>>Astitva Gajendra	11:59
However, the point here is that our team is saying at the time when the user is being added in BambooHR and it is then being added into Zuluri, at that time, this... Not at that time, Siddharth.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	12:14
When the user was marked for onboarding, at that time, the site ID for that user was not present. I'll help you navigate and see this, Dima. Can you go to the audit logs?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	12:28
Yeah. Let's go together. Audit logs, let's go to here. Yes.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	12:33
Let's check together. The user's name, Giovanni, on the search bar.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	12:43
Ah, it's Mafia. He triggered it. Because we were waiting for it, but it hasn't happened.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	12:49
So you could see... Can you scroll down a bit? This user was marked for onboarding multiple times. But if you go to the first log of when this user was marked for onboarding, I think it was 25th of September, if I'm not wrong. Can you scroll down? Scroll down.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	13:10
It's all, I mean, scroll down. He was marked for onboarding in 2nd of October.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	13:19
2nd of October. So at that time, on 2nd of October, this user did not have the site ID value at all.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	13:28
But why can... But again, OK, this user doesn't have site ID, but if I jump...

>>Madhu Malaranban N	13:37
We triggered the automation rule on the 2nd of October, and we checked the condition, what was the site ID for this user? And at that time, it was not Jakarta. It was either not updated, or it was something else, but it was not Jakarta. So the first condition was failing. So that's the point we are trying to make. And this came into our attention when we were debugging this issue with the back -end logs demo.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	14:02
But one second, do you mean... Something's wrong, because it looks like... When I identify that a new user appears here, never mind, it can be Ivan Gupienko, I already can find his site ID. It's meaning I see this user appear in Zulu, and I already can find this... This, this is what I mean, this seller. And it's not like empty or something like this one. Okay, I just rammed, for example, I see... I just want to explain what I see here. For example, okay, we have here services integration. If I go to, for example, oh, not here. If I go to connected services, just want to identify it with you. I go to connected services, for example, Hi, Bob, yes, this service synchronized.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	14:56
Maybe each 24 hour And I just checked when someone new appear here I already can find his site ID It's meaning that and also when you add a user to high

>>Madhu Malaranban N	15:10
Bob You You always have the site ID for that user

>>Dmitry Tabolich	15:13
Yes it's like our main global rule And I already check it through the HR it's like required field they cannot to choose like you know empty value or something like this one when employees created he already have site he if he will be working remotely he will be healthy like a remote something like this one But it's not impossible that he'll be have some empty field here Okay

>>Madhu Malaranban N	15:39
So what I can further you know troubleshoot or dig deeper further from here demise I can check what was the actual site ID when that automation rule got triggered what very much you know

>>Dmitry Tabolich	15:53
But it's funny because it's one before it's meaning that if I again if I scroll it all down you can find it here Yes so you are basically yes it's working But in second I think it's second second October something like this one is stop working it's meaning that it's one before you can see it by Google workspace it's meaning that it's one before But for some reason it may be Yes I think it was in second maybe short October for some reason it stopped working And it's include all automation we have automation about basic access and Etc also I see you know I thought I thought if I remove people from this list because we have a situation and for example if I remove this person from here and high ball again I mean again you'll be have synchronization with the high ball this user again appear here And I thought it will be also like trigger because this user again I feel like market for onboarding and this automation should start working again Maybe I thought you know it's My It was like my idea but this look like it's still not working Yeah I just want to I don't know if you understand what they're trying to say you about this one I hope you know because sometimes I kept feelings it I told something people But it's inside my head everything looking really amazing And I explained perfect But maybe I not it's been perfect I get you Dima

>>Madhu Malaranban N	17:26
So you you're trying to say that after the second of October this automation rule yes correct correct going to work close onboarding go to automation rules yes search for let's say Jakarta Google workspace

>>Dmitry Tabolich	17:44
Yes I just suppress you run

>>Madhu Malaranban N	17:46
Yes or you run yeah is this the one that we are looking at or is it Google workspace Jakarta or it's so automation I mean right now they say all this and you could see that there are runs from the 9th of October in Jakarta basic exercise once you click on view run Okay for example

>>Dmitry Tabolich	18:09
Okay we have let's go to wall show never mind it can be workshop also please fund Okay

>>Madhu Malaranban N	18:18
You have a couple you have one from the 7th of October and you have Okay Okay One second

>>Dmitry Tabolich	18:23
Yeah the 2nd of October And then it stopped working Yes correct it was October look at it it was October And then me and Martin start trying to push it okay I push it is some today because we're waiting that this issue will be fixed it it's working on 2nd of October Correct we have newcomer But then it stopped working and also look at it for basic access for example we have a rule yes or baby cuts in this old one we have rules that when you come to school in the day And it's a duty to do it you can see this should do it to do it But for another conference right now again it's not to do it

>>Madhu Malaranban N	19:06
And I it seems for me this automation stop working and do you have any users who are marked for onboarding between the 2nd of October and 7th of October who pass through this any of the automation rules that are not appearing here

>>Dmitry Tabolich	19:22
Oh no do you have any users examples that I can check with or what we can for example for example this guy this guy since past But it was in 2nd of October But as I say starting from after 6 October the kind of allocations asked asked me do you know why we see why some account is not created in Google accounts that I calculated And I found that subsequent and adjusted to not watching

>>Madhu Malaranban N	19:59
Okay, this particular user that you have highlighted, I can see that the status is, can you view log? Is there any manual tasks in that which is pending for someone to do?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	20:10
Yeah, yeah. One second. That's usually to Microsoft. It's not required for Microsoft, it's just, it's just one account, but for, oh, push there.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	20:20
Okay.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	20:23
But it's, yes, it's pending, but globally, honestly, it's already done. I just want to tell you that for this user, automation is working. Everything's fine. It's meaning, yeah, maybe, okay, this guy just forgot to press the button that he already did it. But main cases about this one, starting from, okay, not 2nd October, 3rd October, automation was working before, stopped working. And I check it, logs, we don't, from outside, we didn't do anything. And also I thought maybe, yes, maybe something with vacation. This is the reason why I was, for example, if I remove today this guy, Sergio, for example, I can remove this guy today. Okay. I can move this guy right now. After synchronization, it seems for me he will appear again because we have already checked this user and this user already appeared here, I have a feeling. But this automation, he, I have a feeling this automation still won't be triggered. But this user already have a location and et cetera. I hope I explained you, again, what is the issue. The issue is that it wasn't before. And when I identified new employer after some Fibop and Zuby synchronization, if I go to user, I can find user location, but I can see it here. I don't know what exactly backend site checking, what field, what site ID checking backend site, but I can find this and I can find location for this.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	22:09
So.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	22:10
Can we, can we quickly check if there were any users who are marked for onboarding between the 3rd of October and 7th of October?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	22:18
I have an idea, by the way, if you want, why not?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	22:22
We can check it in audit logs. We can check it in audit logs.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	22:27
One second, by the way, audit logs, audit logs. Yes, let's go to audit logs and let's check. Yes, triggers.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	22:36
Insert site marked for onboarding. Can you make it marked for onboarding? Can you make it marked? I think it says marked.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	22:54
Yeah.

>>Anupam Acharya	22:56
M -A -R

>>Madhu Malaranban N	22:57
-k -E -D.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	22:59
One second. Okay. Mark it. Yes, yes, yes. Mark it. Check it.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	23:14
So as you can see, there are no users that were marked for onboarding between the 2nd of October and 7th of October.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	23:20
But what about Andrea was marked for onboarding?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	23:26
It's 7th of October. You can check under the run logs. You can copy this name, Adrian.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	23:32
Yeah, this is what we need to do. Okay, let's copy his name. Yeah, I copied his name. Let's go to here.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	23:41
Let's go to workflow run logs.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	23:45
And pass it here.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	23:47
You can filter by name. No, not here. You can filter.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	23:52
One second. I want to remove this one. Filter. Filter. Filter.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	24:00
Run on. Yeah. The third one from the top. Run on. Under status, you have workflow name, status, run on.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:10
Ah, run on. Okay.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	24:12
Oh, sorry.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:16
Maybe user?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	24:18
Yeah, user. Sorry. Yeah.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:20
Yeah, yeah.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	24:21
Okay.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:22
It's okay.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	24:26
Okay. Okay. Fine. Can we check this user?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:36
Yeah. Yeah, let's check it. Yes, it's here. It's here. His status is inactive. And I already can find his location. Because I find Barcelona. Yes, he was added in 7th of October. And automation about creating Google accounts automatically.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	24:54
Also not working. If I right now jump to unblocking again, unlocks. Ok, it was 7 October, but it's honestly I can just detail. Ok, you can. You see that I cannot. We cannot find him here.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	25:07
Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt the moment. Can we go back to the user?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	25:11
What happens? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	25:14
Once again, so it's Barcelona, right? So what is the automation rule that should have ideally got triggered? Uh.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	25:25
Yes, OK, let's jump to Barcelona, uh, Google. Google, one second, Barcelona, let's jump.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	25:34
Let's look at the condition.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	25:36
Yes, it's used to market onboarding. His location will be like this one. You can stay. You can find it right now. I'm using search and this condition is correct. User account type equals employer. He's employer. I resource equals high book because of services is high book. Uh, we have that regress only one location. It means and he's not from Zucker and then This Google Workspace. This playbook will be immediately.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	26:06
Yeah, let's keep this this window open. Let's open a duplicate window and let's look at the parameters of that users user once again.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	26:18
Users. Yes.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	26:22
Think this one is an employee. The user type is yes.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	26:29
Ok, user. Ok, let's check again together. My user microphone boarding site equals Barcelona. Yes, I think it's Barcelona. Yes, OK, user account type equals employer is type is employer. Uh, primary source equals high book series. Uh, let's scroll down. Hi Bob service here.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	26:49
Ok, what can you go back? Can you scroll down, click on? So this is view one.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	26:59
Yeah, sure.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	27:00
Ok, it's that's the primary source.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	27:03
Yeah, as I say, I already checked it and look at it. User primary department looks like this is out here and of course he is not called after department. Departments have their owner already. Yes, he's coming in and it should. It should work. Actually, I see less times that. I'm checking to check it out. Ok, different and I don't know why it's not working.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	27:28
Yeah, so yeah, I can take this one and go ahead and check or dig deeper.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	27:36
I can tell you he's a male by the way. Why not? I don't know if you're recording, but yeah, maybe for you to watch it easily. Yeah, but you can find I mean, I'm not for. Of course I can be a little stupid sometimes, but about this information is just easy to check everything. Yes, and you can find that it's some like a Phoenix. It's like maybe the current site issue because. I cannot find reason. I mean from a front end site. Yes, what is the issue here? I got I compare also all Google sites, all ID And I don't know what is going on. Sure, and as I say, yes, it's working before it's working before. Ok, it's But it's from. Yes, prospecting after 2nd October is stopped working and.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	28:29
Who knows why just one more thing? I have not made a note of this user and will. I'll definitely have this one checked, but can we go back to workflows to this particular rule Barcelona? If we have, you know runs coming in for this particular rule. Can you click on view run? So there are runs that have happened on the 9th of October on the 7th of October. Even on the 7th of October we have a run. So for this user probably.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	29:10
One second, one second. It's a manual trigger. I mean, you can find it. Yes, if we're talking about automation figure, usually you can find your field triggered by workshop basic, but this one figured by Malcolm because we already need to create account for some users. Of course we manually. Yes, you can find it here. Do you? If it was after information working, you know how it's working. I don't need to explain to you, but yes, if it was manually it's here.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	29:44
Got you completely there Dima. This is fine. I think this is enough information for me to go back to the team and check. Apologies that this is not working as expected. I know.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	29:53
You know, you're heavily dependent on these automation rules and, you know. I know, I know.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	29:59
The same for me, you know.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	30:01
I also noticed that at least, of all cases, Sorry about that, but I'll definitely have this one looked at high priority. We'll sit with the team and have this sorted for you, Dima, as soon as possible and share updates with you.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	30:15
Let me know if you need any help, I mean, any updates, because I check, as I say, I check it with the HR side and also they show me how, again, how they create an account, how they create a card, employee card, because this is their job, create employee card, and they don't change anything. They still added all information about site location and it's like a government -required field, meaning that they, it cannot be empty and each time, it's working like this, yes. They didn't change anything. They told me, and also, by the way, I check, they also have audit and, yes, they didn't change anything with Hybop.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	31:02
Sure, sure, Dima. Thank you so much for the detailed, you know, walkthrough and the way that you showed. So, this definitely helps. I'll get this sorted for you and share an update as soon as possible.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	31:17
Yeah, I also will be happy, because, honestly, as I say, sometimes to explain something, especially when you all think that everything's fine, maybe it's my error, because I also have a feeling that it's not happened, you know, from some sites and portals, I mean, from your partners, from your users, employers, I mean, for also using this service, but, yeah. Sure, okay. Honestly, guys, there's no big topics right now, because couple details what Alex asked me to ask you, it's about, and also, I need, I also need it, it will be about Zulu agent, maybe you can tell me about this one, or maybe you, who can tell me about this one, it's about application detection.

>>Astitva Gajendra	32:11
Yeah, sorry, before starting, Madhu, you can go ahead, just an FYI, Mdm is hex node over here. The Mdm is hex node over here, if you can take the questions. Sure, sure, yeah.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	32:25
Yeah, go ahead, Dima. Yeah, honestly, we want to start this deploy Zulu agent to using Mdm, to using laptops, and somehow, I don't know, can we somehow integrate Zulu agent with the Mdm, that employers don't need to add their corporate email, because it's not really like some automation. I mean, if I deploy this package to user laptop, user still need to, if user want to connect to Zulu, he still need to sign by his credential, but can we find some different way how to do it?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	33:11
Okay, so, Dima, when it comes to agents, there are two types of agents, Zulu supports, right?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	33:18
One could be... For macOS. For macOS, desktop detection. I'm sorry, can you please come again? For macOS devices, yes, desktop agent, yeah.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	33:32
Right, so, we have browser agents and desktop agents, and in desktop agents, we can support Windows machines and also Mac Os, right? So, there will be a standalone deployment of agents, where you go into that particular machine, you run an ST, you know, you run an Msi file, install that application, and then authenticate to have that application running on that machine. And on the other hand, this can also be pushed via Mdm, where, you know, you get a script in your Mdm to push these applications onto user machines. And you, you know, we have a script in which you tweak the organization token. So, the organization token, based on that, when this application is installed on user machines, these, you know, these entries will be visible on the platform, on Zuluri, with the machine ID, where you can map the users. Once that is done, then Zuluri will start authenticating those users, and then this application or this agent will become alive on the desktop. And then we'll start tracking the application and its usage. And from that, you know, client application we have on machines, it will be sent every 12 hours. So, we'll retrieve this data of application usage and

>>Madhu Malaranban N	34:52
With which we track the activities of applications and the application discovery also comes into play. So now, as I said, these desktop agents for both Mac and Windows can be deployed via Mdm. The standard deployment documentation that we have at the moment or we support at the moment or via Kanji for Mac Os, Ms Intune for Windows and Mac OS, or you can also use Jumpcloud as an Mdm to push these. But Hexnode is something that we have not touched upon yet, however, we can help you with the generic documentation on how it usually works on an Mdm and for that you can try using that via Hexnode. I can probably bring in my agent implementation team on a working session so that we collaborate and get this done, but we'd be really happy and we can definitely help you in testing this out on Hexnode Mdm as well.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	35:54
Yes, I need it, we really need it and we want to start using it right now.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	36:00
Absolutely. So what I would do is I'll pass on the generic documentation that supports any Mdm. So it usually has a script where you can run on the Mdm and push these MSI files and then that has the detailed steps of it, right? You can go through that review and see if it is feasible on Hexnode. If you can create an application on the client machine via Hexnode, then yes, the straightforward answer is yes, you can deploy glory agents as well. If you can use Hexnode to push an application into a user machine, the client machine, then we are covered there. We can pretty much deploy glory agents as well. So I'm going to send across this generic documentation to you, you can review this.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	36:46
Just one second. You mean that it's about how it's working? We have applications, I upload this application to Mdm and then I deploy this application to user PC, correct? Laptop. Correct. And the application will be just, oh, you cannot see my screen. We have a couple of minutes, maybe, probably I want to do, because it sounds super clear. Oh, it's super clear. Oh, yeah. I still don't have my screen. Okay. Do you mean that we're still using this agent, like Papika agent?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	37:17
And okay, we have this file, will we use it? Not really, right? You don't have to. The script will have...

>>Dmitry Tabolich	37:26
Ah, you're using Sh script, yes?

>>Madhu Malaranban N	37:29
Correct. Okay. So I'm going to create an Mdm, which will have the links to these MSIs that have to be pushed.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	37:35
Yeah, I'm going to publish the Xnode support executed to the script, and I think I just need to finish the script and I will check it, how it's working.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	37:45
Perfect. Yeah. So if you have a confirmation of, yes, you can push an MSI or an executable via your Xnode Mdm to user machines, then we can pretty much try this and we can probably hop onto a working session where we'll have our agents experts as well, and we can get this done over the call.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	38:05
Okay. Then I will be waiting when you send the documentation, maybe you already sent it to me, but please send it to me. Also, I will give you, once again, after this call, contact and schedule a meeting for Alex Kaziakov, too, so we can make some presentation. Also, Mardu, please, this issue is an automation check, it may be our fault, but I'm not sure, honestly. I didn't find any issue, but maybe it's our fault, sometimes it happens. Also, what else? Is there something? Probably, right now, everything is looking fine, but it's my issue right now. It's about automation. Yes. And happy working with you guys, like always. Always a pleasure. It's our pleasure, yeah. Okay. Then, I see. I will contact you right now to Slack. Let's just schedule a meeting. Let's try to schedule a meeting. Let's do it today and not, I don't know, do it later. Because if you do it later, Alex will be busy, but he wants to know some details, some news.

>>Astitva Gajendra	39:08
Okay? Yeah. I'll share that invite to you right away.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	39:13
Already, yeah? Okay. Ah, okay, okay. One second, by the way. Okay. I think it's all for now. Yes, guys. See you next week. Yes. Probably, yes. See you next week. If you already have news about automation, module, this, it helps that channel. Let me know. Yeah. It's all for today, guys. Thank you.

>>Astitva Gajendra	39:44
Thank you, Dima.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	39:45
Thanks, man. Thank you, guys. Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Dima.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	39:48
Bye -bye.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	39:49
Bye. Bye.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	39:54
All right, Dima, see you.

>>Anupam Acharya	39:55
Take care.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	39:56
Have a great week. Funny moment, one second. That's funny moment. If I want, right now, anyway, it's not working. If I want to let it pick me again, I should choose one second.

>>Anupam Acharya	40:07
Yes.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	40:08
I should do like this one. What is that? Right now, you see, camera is not moving. But if I do like this one, it starts moving. And, you know, sometimes, because, like, camera, et cetera, sometimes it's not working right. And like this one, it looks like, you know, if I will have some stomach, it will be working so much. Can you say this? Maybe, maybe.

>>Anupam Acharya	40:36
What does it say?

>>Dmitry Tabolich	40:37
Let me show you something, Dima.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	40:42
Amazing. This is not my automation tool.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	40:45
This is the manual. But, you know, that is also a good solution. Maybe, you know, you can tell me, Dima, everything is fixed and someone will be just sitting in your location each time, you know.

>>Anupam Acharya	41:01
No, no, we don't want to do that, Dima.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	41:04
I think automation is the next. But probably you already have it. Maybe, you know, it's like a day for me. You have some guys who push it to my body. And right now, it's someone just sick

>>Anupam Acharya	41:15
And, you know, it's a waste of time.

>>Dmitry Tabolich	41:18
Absolutely not. System is the best, Dima. The best. Okay, guys.

>>Anupam Acharya	41:26
See you next week.

>>Madhu Malaranban N	41:26
Thank you.

>>Anupam Acharya	41:27
Thank you so much. Have a lovely week. Bye -bye.
