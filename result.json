Start with these key integrations:\n1. SSO (Single Sign-On)\nConnect your SSO provider. For most organizations this is Google Workspace, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, and/or JumpCloud. You can also import a custom CSV. \nThe SSO provider will be the primary source of your organization's data. This includes departments, domains, applications the employees use, sign-in/sign-out activity, and detailed security analysis of every connected application. It is also the single most important integration to discover shadow IT and optimize spendings.\n2. Accounting/finance software\nKeep track of expenses and transactions by integrating accounting software such as Intuit Quickbooks, FreshBooks, or Brex. You can also import a custom CSV. \n3. HRMS (Human Resource Management System)\nConnecting your HRMS will let Zluri track employee data like departments, designations, reporting managers, and joining dates. Zluri supports popular HRMS like BambooHR, Personio, and Keka.\nOther recommended integrations\nHaving set the foundations, add other integrations by exploring the Integrations Catalog. See our curated list of essential integrations and staff picks for starters.\n\ud83d\udcdc Set primary sources\nWith the key integrations in place, you might find that multiple apps might contain the same information. .\nFor example, both Google Workspace and BambooHR might provide employees' designations and profile pictures, but you want the latter to be the source of truth for these.\nTo remedy this, Zluri lets you choose different sources for individual fields.

            "header": "FAQ",
            "content": "What is the difference between \"Map to a different app\" and \"Merge with another App\"?\n\n\nMap: This is used to identify an application not correctly recognized by Zluri (typically due to a variation in the name fetched from SSO). For instance, if Zluri detects \u2018Okta SSO login\u2019 but not \u2018Okta,\u2019 the admin can map \u2018Okta SSO login\u2019 to \u2018Okta,\u2019 and any activity detected for this app will be mapped accordingly thereafter.\n\n\nMerge: This consolidates users and activities of two different detected applications into one. For example, if Zluri detects both \u2018Okta\u2019 and \u2018Okta SSO Login,\u2019 these can be merged. Merging is useful to consolidate users, activities, usage, or app plugins with the main app.\n\n\n\nWhat is the security grade score? Which is accepted to be safe for an application?\nThe Security Grade is a score obtained by scanning the app URL on various websites through https://observatory.mozilla.org/.\nThe score provides an objective evaluation of security, though it cannot be considered a definitive measure of safety. A higher score is generally better, but even an \u2018A\u2019 does not guarantee the app is entirely secure as vulnerabilities may still exist.\n\nApplication discovery - What is the difference between direct integrations and library from a technical standpoint?\n\n\nLibrary: This is a list of SaaS applications for which Zluri has data access, including app name, app icon, feature catalog, plan-wise pricing data, etc. You can manually assign licenses, map transactions, or bulk upload licenses to users for the applications in the Zluri Library.\n\n\nDirect Integrations: These are SaaS applications you can directly connect to Zluri to utilize all the platform\u2019s capabilities. Direct integrations provide:\n\nDiscovery of users and user metadata like email, geolocation, profile image, roles, licenses, and group memberships.\nWorkflow capabilities to directly onboard and offboard users and perform other user-related actions on these SaaS applications.\nProvisioning capabilities to directly assign and remove licenses from users through workflow actions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when the user status is shown as active from an application, but the primary source states that the user is inactive?\nThis scenario is possible when a user is removed from the primary source, but their account is not deleted from the application. In such cases, the user is marked as inactive in Zluri.\n\nDoes marking an application as paid move it to the Managed Section?\nNo, marking an application as paid does not move it to the Managed section. To move an application to Managed, select the application, click on \u201cQuick Review,\u201d and \u201cSet Authorization\u201d from the applications tab.\n\nWhat are the implications of using the App Insights/App Health Metric recommendations?\nApp insights provide a quick overview of:\n\nUsers who haven\u2019t used the application in the last 30 days.\nUsers with low usage in the last 30 days.\nUsers who have been suspended or marked inactive in your SSO but remain active in the application.\n\nYou can review these lists of users and take appropriate deprovisioning actions. It also allows you to quickly edit specific application details that haven\u2019t been configured, such as the app owner, adding contracts, reviewing risk levels, etc.\n\nHow can we segregate paid applications from unpaid applications?\nPaid applications can be identified using filters. Detailed steps:\n\nGo to Applications module.\nClick on Filters -> Add Filters -> Click on Spend -> Set spend greater than zero.\n\nThis displays all applications whose spending is greater than zero, which are the paid applications.\n\nIn which Category would the applications with perpetual transactions fall under (pay once for lifetime access)?\nApplications with perpetual transactions fall under the paid applications column.\n\nIf I have active contracts along with transactions for an application, would these applications be automatically considered Paid applications?\nNo, currently, applications are not automatically classified as paid based on contracts or transactions. This must be done manually.\n\nHow do I see the applications that are archived?\nTo view archived applications:\n\nGo to the Applications module.\nSelect the filter \u201cArchive is archived.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow to unmerge an application?\nYou can merge applications, but once merged, they cannot be unmerged.\n\nHow to merge an application?\nTo merge an application:\n\nSelect the application.\nChoose the three dots and select \u201cMerge with another app.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow do we add a custom field under Applications?\nTo add a custom field:\n\nGo to Settings -> Custom Fields.\nScroll down to find Applications to customize.\n\n\n\nHow do I view the \"Category-Wise\" spend on Applications?\nOn the Zluri platform:\n\nGo to the Overview screen.\nClick the dropdown and select Category to see department-wise spend.\n\n\n\nWhat actions can be taken based on the Application Security Information?\nIT admins can mark applications as restricted based on security information. When someone attempts to use a restricted application, the IT admin is notified and can take action. Access to these applications can be revoked via Google Workspace or Azure AD accounts. Zluri is developing a feature to revoke access directly from its platform.\n\nHow to find the maximum used Application by a User?\nTo find the most-used application by a user:\n\nGo to the Users module and select a user.\nClick on the Applications tab.\nClick the \u2193 (downward arrow) on the usage column to sort applications from most to least used.\n\n\n\nApplication owners and their roles in Zluri\n\nApplication Owner: The app owner assigned in Zluri, typically the admin of the application in your organization. Only the application owner can take actions on certain app insights, like reviewing the application type or risk level.\nFinance Owner: Similar to a finance admin for the application. The finance owner manages budgets and expense-related insights.\nIT Owner: IT owners manage security and risk-related insights for applications.\n\n\nWhen is a user app status marked 'Not in Use' by SSO?\nAn application is marked as \u2018not in use\u2019 through SSO when an active token for the application is not detected for the user. Zluri performs daily syncs with SSO and marks apps as active where a token is detected. Otherwise, they are marked inactive.\nNote: Once marked as \u201cNot in use,\u201d the status can change if the user logs in and activity is detected in SSO. The token will regenerate, and the status will be marked as \u201cin use.\u201d\n\n\nWhat is the user application status when a user is deleted from an application?\nThe user application status in Zluri would be marked as Inactive when a user is deleted from an application. This ensures that the history of access, costs, and spending associated with that user remains intact.\n\nWhat is the character limit for custom text fields added to applications?\nThere is no limit to the number of custom text fields you can add.\nDo we have a log of how \"Active Days (30)\", \"Active Days (60)\", and \"Active Days (90)\" is calculated?\nActive in the last 30, 60, and 90 days is basically calculated from any activity Zluri has observed for users under an application.\nThe last activity can be anything like signing in, logs, other activities shared by direct integration agents. That's where the active days get their data from.\nIt's an addition of all the activity logs we got for an application in the past 30, 60, 90 days.\u00a0  \nThe data pipelines are running to get this data updated regularly.\nHow to bulk update data\nZluri gives you the option to bulk update metadata of each entity by directly uploading the a csv file.

            "content": "What is the difference between Risk and Threat?\nThe \u2018Risk\u2019 level is a holistic metric determined by carefully assessing a set of essential parameters like security events, scopes shared, compliance information, security probes etc. The Risk level can also manually be overridden.\n\u2018Threat\u2019 level is determined based on the app's scopes and permissions to read and edit your data. \nRisk level\nZluri provides you with a 360-degree view of security & compliance with each SaaS application you use in your organization. It considers the following factors while calculating the risk score:\n\nScope risk levels: Scope risk levels are decided by the sensitivity of the scopes they have access. For example, if an application has access to a scope that allows it to access & delete all your Google Drive files, that is considered a high-risk scope. In comparison, if an application has access to a scope that allows you to access only a user's email ID, that is considered a low-risk scope.\nCompliances: The more compliances an application complies with, the more secure the application is. An application such as Slack is compliant with all significant compliances globally. Hence we consider it more secure when compared to an application with a lesser number of compliances.\nSecurity Probes:\u00a0Zluri collects security-related information from third-party websites like syllabus, Immuniweb, imirhil etc. Then Zluri takes the weighted average of these security grades & presents it on the dashboard on a range from A to F- A representing a highly secure application & F being a lowly secure application.\nRecent security breaches: Zluri also constantly monitors the security breaches related to SaaS applications and increases the risk score if a recent security breach related to any application comes to the news.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned factors, zluri assigns a security score rating from 1 to 5, where 1 & 2 means low risk, 3 is medium risk & 4,5 means high risk.\nWhat actions can be taken based on the security scores?\nActions can be taken based on the authorization status of the applications. A few scenarios are explained below.\n\nSuppose a 'restricted' application is identified as a high-risk application. In this case, as an IT admin, you can notify all users of the applications to stop using the application & remove the authentications of the application from the SSO.\nIf an application comes under 'managed IT' is identified as a high-risk application. In this case, You may notify the users to securely access the application using SSO by enabling 2FA. or look for more secure alternatives to the applications.\nSuppose an application that 'needs review' is identified as high-risk. In this case, You may review the application & mark it as either 'managed IT'/'Unmanaged IT'/'Restricted'. Based on the authentication level, you can take appropriate action.\n\nThreat level\nZluri calculates the threat level based on the scopes the application has access to. Based on the sensitivity of the data it has access to and the criticality of the actions it can perform on them.\u00a0\nFor example: A scope which gives access to any application to access & delete your Google drive data is considered to be at a higher threat level than any application which has access to just read Google mail data.Updated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\n\nWhat is the difference between Risk and Threat?\n\nRisk level\nThreat level\n\n\n"

This article lists them down.\nIt can be either one of the reasons or all of them:\n\n\nExternal Users: Those who are not employees of the organisation but are added to different platforms/software for collaboration. They can either be clients, vendors, or freelancers.\n\n\nEmployees tracked from multiple SSOs/Software: There is a possibility of the users being tracked from different software that you have directly integrated with Zluri. They might not be active on one SSO or software but are still active on other platforms like Okta, Slack, Github, Jira, etc.\n\n\nGroup Email IDs: There are IDs created to send emails to a team or selected group of employees, e.g., [email\u00a0protected], [email\u00a0protected].  \nWith this issue, there come two risks:\n\nSecurity Risk: When people who are no longer part of your organisation still have access to various applications/software, they can log in and access important information.\nDollar Risk: You might be paying for some users who are no longer part of the organisation because you forgot to suspend and mark them as inactive on various platforms, leading to continued billing.  \n\nActions you can take to minimize the risk:\n\nKeep track of all the users that are onboarding and offboarding onto multiple platforms.\nEnsure to remove inactive users from all the applications/software they had access to after their offboarding.\n\nIf you still have more questions, please feel free to connect with us through the chat option available in the application.\n\n\nHow do I see users without a license?\nUnder Applications, select your preferred application and navigate to users; select the Add Filters button \u201clicense mapped\u201d as false.\n\n\nHow do I track external users on Zluri?\nGo to users and click on \u201cexternal users\u201d, and then you\u2019ll see the list of all external users.\n\nHow do I bulk import the user data with user status and designation?\nTo bulk import the user data, go to users, choose the three dots, and select \u201cBulk update data\u201d. Download the editable CSV file and then upload the modified CSV.\n\n\nHow do we check the primary source of a user application?\nTo check the primary source of a user application, kindly choose the user and then select the \"applications\" post, where you\u2019ll be able to see all the applications and their sources.\n\nHow do we mark a user inactive on Zluri?\nTo mark a user inactive on Zluri, kindly go to users, select the user, and click on \"change status\", as shown in the below screenshot.\n\nYou can also click on the three dots next to the user and mark them as inactive, as shown in the image below.\n\n\nHow do I see the total number of inactive users?\nTo view the total number of inactive users, go to users and choose the filter \u201cstatus is any of inactive\u201d to view the inactive users.\n\nHow to find if a user has an alternate email address?\nTo find if a user has an alternate email address, go to users and select the user you want to find the email ID for. Once selected, scroll down to find \u201cEmail aliases\u201d and select \"view all\", and you\u2019ll be able to see all the email IDs for this user.\n\nHow is the data under Groups/Services populated?\nIn specific applications such as Okta and Google Workspace, there are options to create a group account. Let us assume that a user, [email\u00a0protected], is created. In that case, it is automatically gathered into employee data. But if specific steps are taken to create this account as a group on the SSO, then the employee data is populated under the Group section, respectively.\nA user can be marked as a \u201cService\u201d account on Zluri by navigating to Users -> Select users who need to be marked as Service accounts -> Bulk Edit -> \u201cChange User Type\u201d -> \u201cService\u201d.\nHow does Zluri add Last Used and Activity Data?\nTwo types of data points related to usage are shown in Zluri's UI:\n\n\nLast Used: Information shown under Application -> Users.\n\n\nActivity: Information shown for each application user.\n\n\n\n\n\"Activity\" comes from multiple sources (SSOs, direct integrations, agents), which provide information about some or all actions performed by that user specific to that Application, each with an activity-specific timestamp.\u00a0  \nActivities can be a few different things - logins (either from SSO or direct integration or agent) or specific actions taken on the platform, which some SSOs give us and some integrations give us (opened this page, ran this export, etc.) but not all. Each activity comes with a timestamp with which we plot all activities over time and have a log of the most recent activity.  \nZluri shows a log of all activities specific to that Application that comes from all of these sources -\u00a0\n\nMost SSOs only provide login activities.\nA few direct integrations provide more in-depth activities (viewed a page, downloaded a report, changed a setting, etc.).\nAgents provide activity info on the Application being used.\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\"Last Used\" info is provided directly by some integrations which tell us exactly what the last login or last used date is\nZluri shows the last used date for that application user based on the most recent date we receive from either activity (from point 1) or the last used date from the integration. If we get neither, we indicate that we do not have a last used date for this app user (denoted by a hyphen \"-\" in the column)\nSome integrations give us the Last Used field by itself, but most don\u2019t. We show either this as is or the most recent activity we got, whichever is the most recent date.  \n\n\nHow we validate \"last used\" data\u00a0\nStep 1\nWe compare two data points -\n\n\n'Raw_last_used' (Data from the direct integration)\n'Db_last_used' (data from all the sources combined: Direct/indirect integration + browsers/desktop agents\nUsing these two data points, we do an internal validation:\u00a0\ndb_last_used >= raw_last_used:\u00a0Validated\u00a0\n\nThis means we're showing the last used date we get from the integration or the most recent activity, whichever is the most recent.\n\n\ndb_last_used is there, but no raw_last_used:\u00a0Validated\u00a0\n\nThis means that we're not getting the last used date from the integration, but we have activity data from other sources\n\n\nraw_last_used is there, but no db_last_used:\u00a0Not validated\n\nThis means that we're getting the last used date from the integration, but we're not processing it accurately\n\n\nraw_last_used > db_last_used:\u00a0Not validated\n\nThis means we're getting a last-used date from the integration, which is not processed accurately; instead, we're displaying stale data.\n\n\nboth fields are empty:\u00a0Validated\n\nThis means that we're not getting any data from activities from all sources or the last used date from the integration, and we're displaying it as it is.\n\n\n\nStep 2\nNext, we compare raw\\_last\\_used with Client shared data:\u00a0\n\n\nIf raw_last_used >= (date shared by the Client):\u00a0Validated\u00a0\nIf raw_last_used < (date shared by the Client):\u00a0Not validated\n\nStep 3\nIf the data is validated from both step 1 and step 2, then we confirm that the last used date shown on the UI is validated, else it is incorrect.\u00a0  \nNote: In case we do not get any activity data from a customer for an application's users, we will need to do only the internal validation mentioned in\u00a0[Step 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmZqSgSpYrQJw2hLEQzLY-QvvJdDleITus_FyPHawDg/edit#heading=h.z6c0wbolr0y4)\n\nCaveats:\nZluri date > Client shared date:\u00a0  \nThis can happen when the Client shares the last used date from one source (or they see a different date in their Application); however, we get the last used information from multiple sources.\u00a0  \nFor applications where we get the data from multiple sources, the last used date shown in the UI is the most recent of all dates we get from different sources.  \nWe store the activity type that we are getting for that Application. If we don't detect any activity type in the activity file, it is taken as a sign-in activity by default.\n\nHow do we use secondary sources to ascertain if a user is active/inactive in a non integrated app?\n\nTo accomplish this, we check the activity data and utilize the last used filter.\nChoose the relevant date and filter it from the source selected as the secondary source.\nWe can assume that the users are not using the application if no activity is detected.\n\nHow do we mark the user as inactive if the status data is not coming in from direct integration?\n\nUntil and unless we don't get a token/activity that says that the user is not using this app anymore, it's marked as active. It can occur through SSO when the user departs from the organisation, and their data is deleted. The login/auth tokens expire for the specific application.\nAdditionally, we can mark the user app status as inactive when offboarding them through workflows to an application that is not directly integrated.\nWhat is the threshold for this? For example, do we mark users as not in use if we don't get token activity for 30/60/90 days?\nFor Okta and Azure, every user added to an application gives this status automatically for apps. So, it's basically the direct source for user-app status.\nFor Google WorkSpace - It was seven days. If we don't get a token, we need to verify this.\nFor Agents, it was seven days. We used to mark user app status inactive if data is not received for more than 7 days.\u00a0\n\nWhat happens when the users are merged?\n\nLet's say we are merging User A to User B[User A--->> User B], the data from User B will be the one that will remain with its attributes and values. User A's attribute values will not override the ones that are in User B.\nUpdated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\n\nHow does Zluri calculate active users?\n\n\nActive Users Discrepancy\n\n\nHow do I see users without a license?\n\n\nHow do I track external users on Zluri?\n\n\nHow do I bulk import the user data with user status and designation?\n\n\nHow do we check the primary source of a user application?\n\n\nHow do we mark a user inactive on Zluri?\n\n\nHow do I see the total number of inactive users?\n\n\nHow to find if a user has an alternate email address?\n\n\nHow is the data under Groups/Services populated?\n\n\nHow does Zluri add Last Used and Activity Data?\n\nTwo types of data points related to usage are shown in Zluri's UI:\n\n\n\nHow we validate \"last used\" data\u00a0\n\n\nHow do we use secondary sources to ascertain if a user is active/inactive in a non integrated app?\n\n\nHow do we mark the user as inactive if the status data is not coming in from direct integration?\n\n\nWhat happens when the users are merged?\n\n"

Four tabs are present here: Licenses, Subscriptions, Contracts and Perpetuals.\n\nFor example, the number near the Licenses tab indicates the number of unique licenses present, and the same applies to the other three tabs.  s\nThe license tab shows only the active groups/ active entities of a particular license. Also, the cost of only the active license group/entity is attributed.\nWhen multiple licenses are active, It shows the average cost/license and sum of quantities of both groups.\n\nE.g., One license has two entities, one from 1st Jan to 1st Aug and the other from 1st Aug to 31st Dec then, based on the date, one of the two entities would be active. On 28th Sept, the second group/entity would be active.\nLicense mapper\nMost licenses are automatically mapped to the users/teams they are associated with.

            "content": "What exactly constitutes Contract Metadata?\nContract metadata in Zluri includes details like contract name, type, owners, start and end date of the contract, description, vendors, etc.\nHow do we differentiate different license terms, such as number of users or number of emails, besides the common ones like spending, and show only the ones relevant to that application\u2019s contract or subscription?\nEach application with a contract uploaded displays the licenses available to that particular app. With respect to the users mapped to each license, we show the number of users against the licenses assigned to them. If a single user possesses multiple emails (as aliases) in Zluri, we consider that as a single licensed user for that application and not two licensed emails.\nHow does auto-increment work in metric-based licenses?\nAuto-increment works only for seat-based licenses. This is because these licenses can be assigned only to users, which does not happen with metric-based licenses.\nHow\u2019s the cost of the contract calculated?\nCost of the contract is the sum total of the cost per licenses and license term, along with any base price and one-time fees minus the discounts that have been entered while uploading the contract into Zluri.\nHow does Zluri get the license information?\nZluri gets the license information for a particular app through direct integration. The APIs pass on the license data, for ex: which license is assigned to a particular user. In case there isn\u2019t a direct integration for a specific application, licenses can also be uploaded manually and mapped to users individually, or they can be uploaded and mapped to users using the Bulk upload feature.\nWhat is the difference between User-based license vs Quantity based licenses:\nUser-based contracts are contracts which are billed on the number of users. User-based licenses can be assigned to a user. In user-based contracts, you will usually find the number of users to the licenses in a particular contract that can be assigned.\nQuantity-based Contracts: here, you are billed based on a specific metric or quantity, for example, the number of emails sent, the number of messages sent etc. Quantity-based licenses cannot be assigned to a user. \u00a0\nHow is the cost for an Individual License calculated?\nIn case the vendor is charging a base fee:-\nThe base fee is the amount the software vendors charges, including a certain number of licenses. Any more licenses beyond this number are charged separately.\nThus, while entering the particulars of such a license, it is essential to check the \u2018I am being charged a base fee\u2019 option. The number of licenses covered in the base fee should be mentioned in the relevant field. After this, the total number of licenses bought should be entered in the relevant field along with additional information like discount, term and quantity. These data points enable Zluri to calculate the right amount.\nIn case there is no base fee charged by the vendor:-\nThe user would be required to enter data for essential fields like quantity, discount (if any)\nWhy is there a difference between \"Cost\" and \"Spend\"?\nZluri gives you two metrics to monitor cost for any contract.\u00a0\nCost: Obtained from the contract value\nSpend: Obtained from the actual transactions.\u00a0\nLet's say a 12 month contract is starting from 01-Jan-2022 uptill 31-Dec-2022 for 100 users at a cost of $3 per user. The cost for the month of January gets calculated as $300. Now let's say there are additional 20 users for which license is purchased in the month of March. Cost for the month of March is calculated as $60. Similarly if there are 30 more users added in the month of September, The cost for September is calculated as $90.\u00a0\nThe spend is not calculated as such. It is the actual spend for the particular app as recorded in the transaction csv or financial systems.\nWhat is the difference between the \"Discount on a line item level\" and the discount entered to the \"bottom of the license\" addition screen?\nAs we see, there are two provisions to add a discount :\n1. Line Item Level\n2. On contract level.\nThe discount on a line item level only applies to that specific line item or license. The discount given at the bottom of the license addition screen applies to the entire contract and applies to all the licenses under that contract.\nHow does Zluri calculate Cost?\nLet's say a 12 month contract is starting from 01-Jan-2022 uptill 31-Dec-2022 for 100 users at a cost of $3 per user. The cost for the month of January gets calculated as $300. Now let's say there are additional 20 users for which license is purchased in the month of March. Cost for the month of March is calculated as $60. Similarly if there are 30 more users added in the month of September, The cost for September is calculated as $90.\nHow is the usage calculated for the Quantity-Based licenses?\nZluri calculates usage only for user activities on an application, which is not applicable for quantity-based licenses.\nHow do we assign Licenses?\nFor some context, there are two types of licenses -\u00a0\n1. User Based2. Quantity Based\u00a0\nOnly User Based licenses can be mapped to the users, read about User Based and Quantity Based licenses in the FAQs.\nThere are two ways to map licenses to users on Zluri. You can either individually assign licenses to each user or Bulk Assign Licenses to multiple users by uploading a sheet.\nIndividually Assigning Licenses\nStep -1: Navigate to the Applications Panel and Select an application. (e.g. Google Workspace)\nStep -2: Navigate to the Users tab for the selected application.\nStep -3: Go to the License Column, click Add License, and select the license you want to assign to the User.\n\nBulk Assigning License :\u00a0\nStep -1: Navigate to the application you want to assign the licenses for.\n\nStep -2: Select\u00a0the Subscription/License you want to assign the users to.\n\nStep -3: Click on \u201cMap Licenses Now\u201d to Bulk map the license to the users.\n\nStep -4: Follow the Prompts to Download the CSV. Fill the sheet in the downloaded format, and upload it back on the platform to Bulk map all your licenses.\nWhat are the two methods we accept licenses on Zluri?\nThe two methods we accept licenses on Zluri are as follows:\n\nUser-based licenses - These are the licenses that are subscribed per user for a period of time.\nQuantity - These are the licenses that are subscribed for a quantity-based product like SMS apps offering plans with N number of messages, marketing apps offering plans with N number of campaigns etc.\u00a0\nNOTE: Generally, user-based licenses can be mapped to users, whereas quantity-based licenses can\u2019t be.\n\nDo we also add perpetual and subscription costs to contract costs? If so, why is it still termed as contract cost?\nWe calculate these costs every month for all types of contracts. We calculate the subscription cost for the next payment term and the perpetual costs for the next financial year. But since a contract is a generic term, we use it for all kinds of contracts.\nHow do I add a custom reminder for contract renewals?\nTo add a custom reminder, Go to licenses, choose contracts, select a contract and add a reminder.\u00a0\nYou can add a reminder for the End date or next payment.\n\n\nWho receives the License/ Contract related notifications?\n\n\nPayment renewal due in x days (E015):\n\n\nApp Owner, App IT Owner, App Finance Owner, Finance Admin, Contract Owner, Contract IT Owner, Contract Finance Owner\n\n\nUpcoming renewals due next month:\n\n\nTemplate Owner, Admin, IT Admin, Payment Owner, Procurement admin\n\n\nRenewal due in x days:\n\n\nApp Owner, App IT Owner, App Finance Owner, Finance Admin, Contract Owner, Contract IT Owner, Contract Finance Owner\n\n\nContract end date reminder:\n\n\nApp Owner, App IT Owner, App Finance Owner, Finance Admin, Contract Owner, Contract IT Owner, Contract Finance Owner\n\n\nContract cancel by a reminder:\n\n\nApp Owner, App IT Owner, App Finance Owner, Finance Admin, Contract Owner, Contract IT Owner, Contract Finance Owner\n\n\nLicense utilization - 80%:\n\n\nAdmin, App Owner, App IT Owner, App Finance Owner, Contract Owner, Contract IT Owner, Contract Finance Owner\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\nWhat exactly constitutes Contract Metadata?\nHow do we differentiate different license terms, such as number of users or number of emails, besides the common ones like spending, and show only the ones relevant to that application\u2019s contract or subscription?\nHow does auto-increment work in metric-based licenses?\nHow\u2019s the cost of the contract calculated?\nHow does Zluri get the license information?\nWhat is the difference between User-based license vs Quantity based licenses:\nHow is the cost for an Individual License calculated?\nWhy is there a difference between \"Cost\" and \"Spend\"?\nWhat is the difference between the \"Discount on a line item level\" and the discount entered to the \"bottom of the license\" addition screen?\nHow does Zluri calculate Cost?\nHow is the usage calculated for the Quantity-Based licenses?\nHow do we assign Licenses?\nWhat are the two methods we accept licenses on Zluri?\nDo we also add perpetual and subscription costs to contract costs?

Zluri offers an Optimization Automation module that streamlines the process of reviewing and acting on underutilized and unused licenses without manual intervention. In this guide, we will explain how to read these reports and how to utilize the insights they provide.  \nUser Flow Steps\n\nUnderstanding the Optimization Reports\nZluri's App Optimization feature provides you with a user-friendly interface to access and analyze license optimization data. To get started, follow these steps:\n\nAccess the App\u00a0Optimization\u00a0Tab:\u00a0\n\n\nLog in to your Zluri account,\nnavigate to your Application's\u00a0Overview\u00a0page, and\u00a0\nclick the\u00a0Optimization\u00a0tab.  \n\n\n\nSummary Overview:\u00a0Within the App\u00a0Optimization\u00a0tab, you will find a summary that includes the following key metrics:  \n\n\n\nOptimizable Licenses:\u00a0This is the sum of 'undeprovisioned', 'unused', 'underused', and 'unassigned'\u00a0licenses.\nWastage:\u00a0An estimate of the potential cost savings based on detected optimizable licenses.\nPotential Savings:\u00a0You can achieve potential savings by optimizing licenses.\nRealized Savings:\u00a0Actual cost savings achieved through previous optimizations.\nConfigurations:\u00a0Configurations to identify the required unused, underused, unassigned, and undeprovisioned licenses.\nOptimize Now:\u00a0\u00a0The button opens a side tab displaying the list of users. You can select playbooks for multiple users and click 'Optimize' to run the playbooks for the selected users.\n\nConfigurations for License Optimization\nBefore diving into the details of the reports, it's essential to understand the configurations that determine how Zluri identifies 'undeprovisioned', 'unused', 'underused', and 'unassigned'\u00a0licenses.\u00a0\nTo access 'Optimization Settings' for the App, click\u00a0Configuration\u00a0on the App. Next, the 'Optimization Settings' pop-up appears with configuration options for the application.\n\nUnused License Detection:\u00a0Configure the period of inactivity to identify unused licenses (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days since last use).\nUnderused License Detection:\u00a0Set the threshold for usage to detect underused licenses (e.g., 30%, 40%, or 50% of usage).\nUnassigned License Identification:\u00a0Define the criteria to identify unassigned licenses, specifying which licenses have not been allocated to users.\nUndeprovisioned License Detection:\u00a0Configure criteria to detect undeprovisioned licenses, which are licenses that have not been removed when users have left the organization.\nCustomize License and Account Selection:\u00a0Select which licenses and accounts you want to optimize based on your specific needs.\n\nFor instance, you may choose not to revoke a free license if it's not being used, but you would want to revoke it if the user has left the organization.  \n\nOnboarding Playbooks\nYou can configure onboarding playbooks for each license optimisation category (unused, underused, unassigned, and undeprovisioned licenses). A playbook consists of a set of actions that can be run on one or more users. Here's how to set up and configure onboarding playbooks:\n\nSelect Playbook Actions:\u00a0\nChoose actions that should be executed when optimizing licenses. These actions can be automated, manual, custom HTTP requests, or integrated with Jira.  \nAutomated Actions:\u00a0\nIf your application has direct integration with Zluri, you can perform actions directly through APIs.  \nManual Tasks:\u00a0\nIn cases where direct integration is unavailable, Zluri can trigger mail or Slack notifications to assignees who can mark tasks as completed. These tasks will be visible in the task dashboard.  \n\n\n\nCustom HTTP Request:\u00a0\nSend a custom HTTP request to an API or webhook for further actions.  \n\n\n\nJira Actions:\u00a0\nAssign tasks to Jira, and completed tasks will be synchronized with Zluri.\n\n\n\nRequest to Forego:\u00a0\nZluri can ask users whether they want to keep a license or release it based on their responses. You can configure actions based on their choices and monitor user responses in the platform.  \n\n\n\nSet Playbook Frequency:\u00a0\nDefine how frequently each playbook should run to remove or downgrade licenses for users.\n\nSlack Notifications\nFor scheduled playbooks for continuous optimisation, you can enable Slack notifications to inform administrators about the list of optimizable licenses. This helps keep the app users informed and engaged in the optimization process.\n\nTo enable Slack notifications, click\u00a0Configuration\u00a0to open 'Optimization Settings' pop-up,\u00a0\nUser the required category, click 'CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION' and make sure the 'Receive Notification' checkbox for 'via Slack' is checked.  \n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nUtilizing Optimization Reports\nOnce you've configured your settings and playbooks, you can utilize the insights from the optimization reports to take action:\n\nIdentify Underutilized Licenses:\u00a0Review the 'Optimizable Licenses' to see the number of licenses that can be optimized across all four categories.\nEstimate Potential Savings:\u00a0Use the 'Wastage' to estimate the potential cost savings.\nReview Realized Savings:\u00a0Check the 'Realized Savings' to see the actual cost savings achieved through previous optimizations.\nExecute Playbooks:\u00a0Utilize the playbooks to take automated or manual actions on identified licenses, such as revoking, downgrading, reassigning, provisioning, or de-provisioning them based on the specific category.\nMonitor Results:\u00a0Regularly review the optimization reports to track the impact of your actions and make necessary adjustments to configurations and playbooks.\nUpdated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\nUser Flow Steps\nUnderstanding the Optimization Reports\nConfigurations for License Optimization\nOnboarding Playbooks\nSlack Notifications\nUtilizing Optimization Reports\n"

            "content": "Zluri's scoring system provides valuable insights into employees' applications and user usage within an organization. This document breaks down the context behind the scoring, weight distribution, and calculations considered for measuring 'application usage' and 'user usage' within organizations using the Zluri platform.  \nApplication Usage Scoring\nZluri considers\u00a0Average Volume (AV),\u00a0Average Activity Days (AD), and\u00a0Percentage of Users (PU)\u00a0as the three primary factors to measure usage scoring for applications. Also, it assigns a\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0percentage defining the relative importance or contribution of each factor (AV, AD & PU) in the overall calculation of the final application usage score.\nDefinitions and Examples\n1. Average Volume (AV)\nAverage volume of activity fetched per user per month.\n\nDefinition: Frequency of user activity fetching for a specific application per month. This can be sign-in logs, activity logs, etc.\nExample Scenario: For instance, if a user signs up thrice a month with five activities tracked in the activity log, Zluri calculates these counts based on the proprietary technical logic and assigns a predefined AV score to the calculated number.  \n\n2. Average Activity Days (AD)\nAverage number of activity days for a month.\n\nDefinition: Number of days any user is active in a month. This can range from 1 day to 31 days a month, depending on the month.\u00a0\nExample Scenario: For instance, if a user signs up thrice a month with five activities in one day, Zluri calculates the days' count and assigns a predefined AD score to the calculated number.  \n\n3. Percentage of Users (PU)\nPercentage of users who use this app (adoption rate).\n\nDefinition: Adoption rate indicating how many users from the organization are using a specific application.\nExample\u00a0Scenario: For instance, if there are 100 users in the organization, and 50 use the application, Zluri calculates the percentage and assigns a predefined PU score to the calculated percentage.\n\nFinal Application Usage Score\nThe total Application Usage score is generated by combining\u00a0AV,\u00a0AD, and\u00a0PU, also factoring in the assigned\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0percentage, which defines the relative importance or contribution of each calculated factor.\nRefer to the\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0section for a detailed understanding.\nUser Usage Scoring\nZluri considers\u00a0Monthly Count (MC),\u00a0Mean of Monthly Count,\u00a0Distinct Days (DD), and\u00a0Mean of Distinct Days\u00a0as the four primary factors to measure usage scoring for users. Also, assigns a\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0percentage defining the relative importance or contribution of each factor (MC, MeanMC, DD & MeanDD) in the overall calculation of the final user usage score.\nDefinitions and Examples\n1. Monthly Count (MC)\n\nDefinition: Number of activities a user has in a month.\nExample\u00a0Scenario: For instance, if the number of activities for a user is more than or equal to one, Zluri calculates the activity count and assigns a predefined MC score to the calculated count.\n\n2. Mean of Monthly Count\n\nDefinition: Average monthly count in the past three months.\nExample\u00a0Scenario: For instance, if the average number of activities for a user in the past three months is more than or equal to one, Zluri calculates the average activity count and assigns a predefined Mean of Monthly Count score to the calculated count.\n\n3. Distinct Days (DD)\n\nDefinition: Number of days of activity received for a user in the past month.\nExample\u00a0Scenario: For instance, if the number of days of activity received for a user is more than or equal to one, Zluri calculates the days count and assigns a predefined DD score to the calculated count.\n\n4. Mean of Distinct Days\n\nDefinition: Number of average distinct days in the past three months.\nExample\u00a0Scenario: For instance, if the average number of distinct days in the past three months for a user is more than or equal to one, Zluri calculates the average days count and assigns a predefined Mean of Distinct Days score to the calculated count.\n\nFinal User Usage Score\u00a0\nThe total User Usage score is generated by combining\u00a0MC,\u00a0Mean of MC,\u00a0DD\u00a0and\u00a0Mean of DD, also factoring the assigned\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0percentage, which defines the relative importance or contribution of each calculated factor.\nRefer to the\u00a0Weight Distribution\u00a0section for a detailed understanding.  \nWeight Distribution\u00a0\nWeight distribution in the context of Zluri's Application Usage and User Usage scoring system refers to the relative importance or significance of each factor in the overall calculation of the final usage score. The assigned percentage of weight distribution values determines how much influence each factor has on the final score.\nApplication Usage Weight Distribution\nFor Application Usage, three factors are considered: AV, AD, and PU. The weights assigned to each factor reflect the perceived importance of each aspect in assessing application usage within an organization.\n\nAV: The percentage value assigned represents the importance of the frequency of application use.\u00a0\nAD: The percentage value assigned reflects the significance of user activity days on an application.\u00a0\nPU: The percentage value assigned reflects the contribution organizational adoption rate.\u00a0\n\nUser Usage Weight Distribution\nFor User Usage, four factors are considered: MC, Mean of MC, DD, and Mean of DD. The weights assigned to each factor reflect the perceived importance of each aspect in assessing user usage within an organization.\n\nMC: The percentage value assigned reflects the importance of the user's engagement level within a specific timeframe.\nMean of MC: The percentage value assigned reflects the significance of assessing the user's historical engagement.\nDD: The percentage value assigned reflects the essence of assessing the consistency of user activity.\nMean of DD: The percentage value assigned reflects the significance of assessing the historical consistency of user engagement.\nUpdated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\n\nApplication Usage Scoring\n\nDefinitions and Examples\nFinal Application Usage Score\n\n\n\nUser Usage Scoring\n\nDefinitions and Examples\nFinal User Usage Score\u00a0\n\n\n\nWeight Distribution\u00a0\n\nApplication Usage Weight Distribution\nUser Usage Weight Distribution\n\n\n"

This option will allow users to prevent optimization from running on specific roles or users.\nYou can add \u2018Optimization Inclusion\u2019 as a column under the App Users and Users table to exclude users.\u00a0\nThis column will not be available by default in the Main view. It can be added and saved as a Custom view.  \n\nOnce added as a column, we will have four options available:\n\nExclude for Unused\u00a0\nExclude for Undeprovisioned\nExclude for all optimization\nInclude for Optimization\n\n\nUsers can select the type of optimization from where they want to exclude the users. Users will be Included for Optimization by default.\nYou can also bulk update the Optimization inclusion status of the users in the UI.\n\nApp Users\nIf changes are made to this section for any user, the flag will be considered, and the changes will be effective only for this application.\nUsers table\nIf changes are made in the Users section, the flag will be considered and changes will be effective for all the licenses assigned to the user for all applications.\nFAQ\n\nIf I exclude a user for Unused optimization, will it have any impact on the Undeprovisioned optimization for that user?\n\nNo, the user will still show in the undeprovisioned optimisation user list \u00a0if identified. The user will only be excluded for Unused optimization.\n\nWill users be able to set exclusion separately for 30/60/90 days for Unused licenses?****\n\nNo, selecting unused licenses will exclude it from unused licenses for 30, 60, or 90 days. You cannot select the days' criteria separately.\n\nFor Continuous Optimization, what happens to the past runs data?\n\nThere will be no changes to the past runs data. If a user was identified as optimizable before being excluded from optimization, past run data will still reflect their details. Changes will be effective from the next run onward.\n\nWhat happens to Request to Forego Reminders/notification?\n\nIf a user is excluded from optimization after a Request to Forego notification or Reminder notification has been triggered, these reminders will continue to be sent as per the configured settings.\nThe user will be excluded from future runs, but ongoing reminders will not be affected.\n\nHow are Scheduled/Future Continuous optimization runs impacted?\n\nIf an optimizable user is excluded from optimization, they will be excluded from all upcoming runs. Optimization rules and triggers will not apply to them.\n\nWill I be able to update the Optimization inclusion status after redirecting from Optimization summary?\n\nYes, we can update the user\u2019s Optimization Inclusion status when redirecting to the user list from the Optimization Summary for an app. These changes will apply only to the specific app and user(s) for whom the modifications are made. The updates will be visible in the UI after the next view refresh.\nIn the Users module, a user is Excluded for all Optimization but in App users (for a specific app), it is changed to only Unused licenses\n\nWhat happens to the exclusion behavior in that app?\n\nThe changes made in the App users table for the specific user will take precedence and the user will be excluded for only Unused licenses optimization for that app.\n\nWhat happens to the other apps where user is detected as Optimizable?\n\nFor the other apps, the user will continue to be considered as \u2018Excluded for all Optimization\u2019. No changes.\n\nWhat happens if I make changes again to the Optimization Inclusion status for the user at the User level after updating at the App level?\n\nIf changes are again made to the optimization inclusion status at the User level, it will override the status at the App level (the latest status will be taken into consideration).\nThe status set at the User level will reflect at the App user level and it will be applicable for all the user apps.\n\nIf a new app is detected and a user is part of that app, how will the behaviour work?\n\nIf a new app is detected and the user is part of that app, then the status set at the User level will be considered for the app. If there\u2019s no specific status set at the User level, then the user will be considered Included for Optimization by default.\n\nWill the savings data be automatically updated once changes are made to the Inclusion status?\n\nYes, the potential and realized savings data will be updated based on the Optimization inclusion status set and will reflect in the UI once the views are refreshed.Updated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\nApp Users\nUsers table\nFAQ\n"

On selecting \"Show Unmanaged Apps,\" an employee can view all the unmanaged applications in the organization.\nDepending on your organization's internal security compliance and application provisioning process, you can configure the settings here accordingly.\nExamples\n\u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If your organization needs employees to see only the applications used within their department, which they can then request licenses for, you can choose \"Employee Department Apps.\"\n\u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you only need your employees to see applications that your IT admins have categorized as \"managed\" apps within Zluri, you can turn off the options to show unmanaged, restricted, and uncategorized apps\n\u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you do not need your employees to see security and compliance information about a particular application within the app store, you can turn off the options to show security information and compliance.\nWhile employees can still search for, find information about, and raise requests for ~225k applications within Zluri's library, configuring these settings upfront will ensure employees see only the information they need to see about the IN USE applications within your organization.\nA unique feature of access management is the branding of the organization. Both logo and the favicon can be uploaded.\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nConfiguring automation rules for approval workflows\nAutomation rules help your employees' license and application requests go through the appropriate approval processes followed within your organization.\u00a0  \nAutomation Rule Sections\nTo set up an Automation Rule, click on App Requisition - -> Automation Rules--> New Rule.\n\nAn automation rule consists of five sections:\nRequest Type\nSuppose your organization has different approval processes for applications already in use (License of an Existing Application is Requested) and not used (New Application is Requested) by your organization. In that case, you can use this option to differentiate the two.\n\u00a0\nConditions\nYou can customize your approval workflows by creating multiple automation rules with different conditions. Sample scenarios -\n\nUsers who have a \"Manager\" designation and users who have an \"Associate\" designation.\nUsers with an \"Employee\" account type and users with a \"Service\" or \"External\" account type.\nMembers of the \"Sales\" or \"Marketing\" department and members of the \"Engineering\" department.\n\nYou can differentiate the approval processes using different conditions in different automation rules for these above scenarios and much more.\n\u00a0\nActions\nFor a specific request that fits the request type and conditions specified above, you can set up the rule to either initiate an approval process that'll go through a list of approvers you've configured or automatically reject the request.\n\nApprovers\nFor requests not auto-rejected, you can select one or more approvers responsible for reviewing the request and approving or rejecting it accordingly.\nYou can assign specific roles as approvers - the default dropdown when you \"add people\" will contain a list of roles configured within Zluri, such as IT admin, app owner, department head, and reporting manager.\nThis is helpful in scenarios when the user's reporting manager or department head needs to approve each request before it moves onto a different approver. Alternatively, specific individuals can also be searched for and added as approvers.\nConfiguring this section is mandatory for a rule to be saved.\n\nProvisioning and de-provisioning actions\nOnce a request is approved, the license needs to be provisioned to the user, which can be configured in the \"On approval\" section. And once the requested license duration is completed, the license de-provisioning process can be set up in the \"Offboarding action\" section.\nIn both scenarios, the setup is very similar. The provisioning and de-provisioning actions can be configured as a manual task - select a task owner who'll be notified to procure a license once the request is approved (in case of provisioning) or remove license access once the duration has ended (in case of de-provisioning), and specify within how many days the task has to be completed.\nThe \"on approval\" section configuration is mandatory to save a rule. \"Offboarding action\" is optional.\n\u00a0\nAfter entering all the above-required details, the automation rule can be saved that will look like this:\u00a0\n\nAutomation rules priority\nWhen multiple rules are set up, they can be arranged in decreasing order of priority. For example, if two rules have similar conditions and different approvers are involved or other provisioning/de-provisioning actions are configured, the rule with the higher priority takes precedence.\n \u00a0\nAutomation rule setup best practices\n\u25cf\u00a0Identifying your organization's current approval process broadly can help set up a few basic rules that can serve most of your employees' application requests while giving the admins enough context to customize the rules even further.\n\u25cf\u00a0Ensure all roles, either Zluri administrator roles or roles that differ from one app to another (app owner) or one employee to another (reporting manager or department head), are comprehensively configured(under Users and Department sections) so that the approval process does not run into any obstacles.\nApproval Process\nOnce an employee submits a request, approvers will be notified in a sequential order to approve or reject the request.\nIf an approver is unavailable, admins can add new approvers to this request to take this action in place of them, or the admins can approve or reject the request on behalf of the approver.\n\nOne can click on the three dots for an application to view the submitted request.\n \nOn clicking the View Request, an employee/approver will be able to view all the details necessary for him to approve or reject the request and also some other information (like View Change log, The app is used in the org or not, Other approvers for this request, offboarding actions, request due days, comments by others) which is highlighted in the below screenshot:  \n\n\u00a0 \nIn this approval process, the power to override the approval or rejection decision depends on the authority level. The higher authority can override the decision taken by the lower admins or the managers.\nThe admins can also add comments explaining why the particular request was rejected.\u00a0\nUpdated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nApp store settings configuration\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nConfiguring automation rules for approval workflows\n\nAutomation Rule Sections\nAutomation rules priority\nAutomation rule setup best practices\n\n\n\nApproval Process\n\n"

Saving it triggers the rule reflected on the \"request summary\" page.\n\n\n\nProvisioning and De-provisioning\nOnce all approvers approve a request, the task owner will be notified to add the user(s) to the application, post which they can mark the task as completed.\nDoing this will ensure that the employee is added to the application's list of users and that the assigned license is also mapped to the user for the admins to monitor going forward.\n\nChangelog\nThe employee has to keep track of the changes in this process.

There is also a recommended section that lists the apps used in your organization to integrate, a connected section that lists the apps connected by an organization at present and a pending requests section that shows a list of requests sent to co-workers for integration connection along with their status.\n\nThe Integration module has 3 main subdivisions as follows:\u00a0\nRecommended: This section lists the apps which are highly recommended for integration. Recommended integrations are populated based on the most widely used apps used by users across your organization, Zluri fetches this information from the SSO you connect. Zluri recommends you to integrate with such apps, in case, integration is available for them.\nConnected:\u00a0This section lists the apps already integrated with Zluri.\nConnection Requests:\u00a0This section lists the apps which have already requested to be connected but are awaiting authorization or require the request to be resent.Updated about 1 month ago "

            "content": "Let us describe instances with the help of a popular Zluri integration ex: Google Workspace.\u00a0\n\nWhat are instances, and how can you view them?\u00a0\n\nAns:\u00a0Go to the Sources -> Integrations menu on the dashboard and select Google Workspace. You can see the option Instances highlighted with a list below. These list items are the instances available for Google Workspace:\n\nThe integrations section allows you to add, remove, and customize instances for all integrations. Here, the term\u00a0\u2018Instance\u2019\u00a0is a generic term which refers to each connection associated with an application. For example, when you integrate Google Workspace into the dashboard, multiple connections with different scope permissions for different use cases can exist. These connections are referred to as instances.  \nScopes\nAns: In the previous section, we discussed how instances are connections you create for an application. With that perspective in mind, Scopes are the permissions required by Zluri to connect an instance. These scopes can be mapped to the capabilities that Zluri offers. In other words, to fetch/edit user data and other user metadata from an integration, you need to provide Zluri access to specific permissions and these permissions are called Scopes.  \nThe following types of scopes are available for Google Workspace:\n\n\nRequired Scopes: These are the basic level permissions that are required to be enabled for each specific instance of Google Workspace. This is necessary to retrieve data from the organization's domain and its users. The screenshot above shows how each scope has been marked by a red asterisk on the right, indicating that this is mandatory.\nOther Scopes:\n\nThese Scopes are utilised for Use cases other than discovering users and User metadata. These are utilised for executing workflow actions for adding a user to an app, assigning a license to a user etc while onboarding and Deleting user from the app, Revoking user license from the app etc while offboarding. You can provide permission to these scopes to utilise the Onboarding/Offboarding workflows and License provisioning capabilities in Zluri directly through workflow actions.\n\n\n\nScopes For Discovery:\u00a0These scopes are necessary for fetching information like User data metadata, user group data, user group subscriptions data and user aliases data. Zluri only utilises these scopes only for fetching data, not for editing data.\u00a0\nThe main reason for permitting these kinds of scopes is that they primarily harness the data from the background through one of Zluri\u2019s five powerful discovery methods to trace the data and take relevant actions. Some of these are optional.\n \n\n\nScopes For Workflows: These scopes are required for workflow capabilities in Zluri; they allow Zluri to read and edit User data and metadata for your application. You can utilise the onboarding/offboarding and provisioning capabilities in Zluri by allowing these scopes on Zluri. These are optional, generally.\n \n\n\nHow do I check which scopes are connected/disconnected from my Google Workspace?\n\n\nAns:\u00a0Go to the Integrations menu on the dashboard and select Google Workspace. Click on the name, and a side menu opens. Select the scopes button to open the Scopes menu and find the connected/disconnected scopes list. Ex:  \n\nSee info about users on your domain\nView groups on your domain\nView domains related to your customers\nView organization units on your domain\nView groups on your domain\nManage data access permissions for users on your domain\nView usage reports for your G Suite domain\nView audit reports for your G Suite domain\nView and manage G Suite licenses for your domain\n\n\n\nI opened my dashboard and did not find Google Workspace. How do I find it?\n\nAns: This may happen because your Google Workspace is under the connected integrations menu. Open the Integrations menu from the Dashboard. On the left you will see 3 options under For You -\u00a0Recommended, Connected and Connection Requests. Select the Connected Option. If you do not see the Google Workspace option, type the same in the Search menu and it will appear in the search list.\n\n\nI tried to add a new scope to my Google Workspace, and it failed. What should I do?\n\nAns:\u00a0If there is an error in connecting a scope, you can re-attempt to connect the scope using a similar process with the same Reference URL. Click on the Add Instance button in the Google Workspace option. Enable the scope you want to add and proceed to the connection authorization request. If the connection authorization process does not work, you can try to get it done using the Send to a co-worker option. If your co-worker can also not authorise the connection, please contact the Support team.\n\n\nWhat is the average sync time for Google Workspace SSO?\n\nAns:\u00a0The sync time is approx. 24-48 hours.\n\nHow to validate user data for integration with Google Workspace?\n\nTo check user data for a particular application, open the Zluri Dashboard and navigate to the application -> user screen.\nGoogle Workspace:\n\nDownload the google workspace users and filter the users with status = active. The user count should match the count from the Zluri application with source = Google Workspace and User application status = active.\n\nHow do I add/remove an instance from Google Workspace?\n\nAns: From the integrations menu in the Zluri dashboard, you can select the add instance button directly from the Google Workspace menu or browse catalogue option and access the Google Workspace from the Integrations catalogue menu. The Google Workspace window opens. On the top left, you can click on the Connect an instance button to connect an instance and select subsequent scopes for the same before sending for authorization.\n\n\nSelect the view instances option from the Google Workspace menu to delete an instance. This will take you to a separate Google Workspace menu under the Integrations menu in Dashboard. From here, you can view the list of instances that are disconnected or have some error under Google Workspace. To remove such an instance - select the three-dot menu on the top right of an instance and select the remove option.\n\nNote:\u00a0\n\nYou can also add an instance from the Google Workspace menu under the Integrations menu in Dashboard. Click the button \u201cAdd Instance\u201d on the top right.\nThe user will remove all existing data associated with Google Workspace and its scope by removing an existing instance. This data will no longer be available.\n\n\nHow do I connect/disconnect an instance from Google Workspace?\n\nAns:\u00a0Open Google Workspace under the browse catalogue menu. Click on View All Instances. From the Google Workspace window that opens, you can see the list of instances that are connected/disconnected.\nClick on the reconnect option in red below an instance to connect a disconnected instance. This will take you to the scope integration menu, and you will need to authorize the instance again, as previously discussed.\u00a0\n\nTo disconnect an instance, select the three-dot menu on the top right and select the Disconnect option. Remember that if you disconnect an instance, any new data will not be synced with Zluri Dashboard, but the previously synced data will still be available.\n\n\nWhat should I do if my instance is disconnected due to a change in the admin account?\n\nAns:\u00a0This may happen if the admin account is deactivated or the permissions associated with an admin account are changed due to the existing admin leaving the organization. In such cases, you can either add a new instance with new admin account credentials or reconnect an existing instance with the new admin account credentials.\nZluri recommends you choose the second option from above. This will ensure no loss of previously recorded data, and the dashboard will retrieve and sync the pre-existing data without any loss. In case a new instance has to be created, all previous data will be lost.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\nScopes\n"

            "header": "FAQ",
            "content": "How long does it take for a newly connected integration\u2019s data to be fetched? What are data syncs and its types?\nData syncs are of two types:\n\nFull Sync: This type fetches last year\u2019s data from SSOs like Google Workspace or Azure AD. This includes only activity data and happens only once during the initial setup.\nPartial Sync: This sync occurs once every 24 hours and fetches a list of licenses and users, replacing the list fetched from the previous sync.\n\nWhen a new integration is connected, user data doesn\u2019t instantly show up in the modules. The sync time information is displayed to the user next to the instance connection page through the \"last sync time\".\n\nWhat is \"connecting multiple instances of SaaS applications\"? Are the number of direct integrations for competitors the same, or do they need to be updated?\nOne integration can be connected multiple times to the same Zluri account by an organization with different scopes and permission levels. The user data for these instances is fetched separately. This feature is useful for organizations with subsidiaries using the same app or different departments using separate accounts for an app.\n\nWhile onboarding a user, does Zluri read their data (such as email ID, etc.) from an HRMS system?\nThe primary source for collecting employee email IDs and other employee data (known as attributes) on Zluri can be manually selected by an organization. In general, data is collected from all possible sources, with the attribute fetched from the primary source overriding the same attribute fetched from other integrations. This applies to all integrations, whether they are HRMS, SSO, or other SaaS apps.\nTo read employee attributes like email ID and departments from a particular source (e.g., an HRMS), you need to set the primary source for fetching the attribute to the app you want.\nFor instance:\nIf you have selected Bamboo HR as the primary source for employee email IDs, then in the \"Users\" section on Zluri, the email IDs for the employees will be fetched from BambooHR and not from other sources. However, if a user found on Zluri through one of the integrations is not present on Bamboo HR but is relevant to the organization, then the email ID for that user will be fetched through that integration.\n\nI want to connect to 2-3 integrations. How long does it take to display the data from these new integrations?\nThe time depends on the size of the organization, as the data volume generally correlates with the organization's size. Fetching large amounts of data takes longer due to API rate limits. After data is fetched via API calls, it is stored in JSON format in AWS S3 (our cloud storage platform) under:\nZluri integrations -> *Org ID* -> *Integration ID* -> *Instance ID* -> *Year* -> *Month* -> *Date* -> *Sync ID*\nAll files and data obtained from that application are stored there. Once the sync is finished, processing starts. The integration and data teams read and process the data, storing it in the database. For each connected instance, there is a sync runtime, which runs daily (i.e., once every 24 hours).\n\nHow do Zluri notifications on Integration Connection Requests work?\nWhen an integration is connected via the invite flow, i.e. when you Send the integration connection request to a coworker, all the future notifications regarding the integration will go to the one who connected the integration.\u00a0  \nIn cases when an integration becomes erroneous and is connected via invite, Zluri triggers a notification in specific intervals(2,7,15.30 days) to the user who connected the integration in the first place to reconnect the integration.\u00a0  \nThe user needs to approve the reconnection request, in case, the user decides not to connect the integration again, Zluri will keep on notifying the user to reconnect the integration in the intervals(2,7,15.30 days) mentioned.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\nHow long does it take for a newly connected integration\u2019s data to be fetched?

If a user is present in all workspaces with is_guest = true, then the license is not assigned.\nHow to validate the data?\nYou can visit the Asana Admin console at: https://app.asana.com/admin/1188606260300797/members\n\nThe sum of Members + Guests + Pending Invites will be equal to the total count of active users in Zluri which can be fetched by applying the source = 'Asana' and User Application Status = True, Filter.\nThe license count would be sum of members + pending invites.\nNote: Asana API does not provide the users with pending invite status separately. Hence event users in Pending Invite status is presented as active users. This is a limitation from Asana API and not an error in Zluri data processing.Updated about 1 month ago "

This is a limitation of the HubSpot API and is not at Zluri data processing end.Updated about 1 month ago "

This action can be used for cases where users would like to trigger a workflow in a third-party application and mark the action as completed in Zluri once the workflow has completed in the third-party application.\n \nThe action has two steps:\nStep 1 - Configuring the HTTP request\n\nAdding the webhook URL that needs to be called along with the type of request (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)\nConfiguring the headers and parameters that need to be sent in the request body\nFor the HTTP request with callback action, Zluri will also send the zluri_execution_id for that action along with the configured parameters.\u00a0\n\nStep 2 - Configuring the callback URL for that action in the external application or service\n\n\nA callback URL unique to that specific action is automatically generated from Zluri\u2019s end that can be configured on the end application or service that the HTTP request is made to. You can copy the callback URL from Zluri\u2019s UI to the external service that you want to make the HTTP request to\n\n\nThe callback URL is expected to be a POST request with the format being:\nurlhttps://api-ext.zluri.com/ext/workflows/callback/action/action_id?zluri_execution_id={{zluri_execution_id}}\n\n Replace the text between the braces {{...}} with your execution ID.\n\n\nZluri expects the \u201cstatus\u201d to be sent in the body of the callback request - Accepted values for the status field are \u201ccompleted\u201d and \u201cfailed\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\nZluri expects the \u201czluri_execution_id\u201d to be sent as a parameter in the callback request - This value will be auto-generated when the action is triggered from Zluri and sent as a parameter in the body of the HTTP request.  \n\n\nZluri will also require an \u201capi_key\u201d or \u201capi-key\u201d to be sent in the headers for authentication when making the callback request. You can contact your Zluri support representative to get the value of the API key for your organization.  \n\n\nOnce this action is configured on both Zluri and the external application or service, if you\u2019d like to test the callback request, you can make a test call to Zluri using the callback URL generated on the UI along with the status, the api_key, and a zluri_execution_id value of 11111111. If you receive a \u201c200 OK\u201d response when making the test call, that indicates that the test call is successful.\nIf the action has failed from Zluri\u2019s end or the callback request is configured incorrectly, you can check the error or work with Zluri support to resolve any errors from Zluri\u2019s end and retry. On successful completion of the action, Zluri will change the status of the action from \u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cpending\u201d to \u201ccompleted\u201d on Zluri\u2019s logs.Updated 24 days ago "

Users who do not belong to these domains are termed external users. The list of trusted domains is not editable by the organization\u2019s admins on Zluri.\nPrimary Source: Zluri could be getting data for the same field from various sources; in such cases, the data from the primary source is given precedence.\nFor example, if a user is discovered in Zluri from both Bamboo HR and 1Password but has used a different email ID to log in to 1Password, and if the primary source for the email ID on Zluri is set to Bamboo HR, then the email ID from Bamboo HR is listed for the user in the Users tab.\n\nHow to rotate SAML certificate in Zluri\nThe X.509 certificates have a defined lifetime (e.g., in Google Workspace, it has a validity of 5 years). You should rotate a certificate if it's about to expire or if it becomes compromised. If a certificate expires before you rotate it, your users won\u2019t be able to use SSO to sign in to any SAML applications that use that certificate until you replace it with a new certificate.\n \nTo rotate the certificate:\n\nOpen the SAML app in your SSO, navigate to the certificate page, and recreate it.\nOnce you get the new certificate, please upload it to the Zluri platform.\n\n \nSave the connection, and you can continue to use the SAML connection as configured.Updated about 1 month ago Table of Contents\nHow do I change the financial year for a specific organisation on Zluri?\nHow do I set up two-factor authentication?\nWhat is the role of the trusted domain and the primary source?\nHow to rotate SAML certificate in Zluri\n"

Start with these key integrations:\n1. SSO (Single Sign-On)\nConnect your SSO provider. For most organizations this is Google Workspace, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, and/or JumpCloud. You can also import a custom CSV. \nThe SSO provider will be the primary source of your organization's data. This includes departments, domains, applications the employees use, sign-in/sign-out activity, and detailed security analysis of every connected application. It is also the single most important integration to discover shadow IT and optimize spendings.\n2. Accounting/finance software\nKeep track of expenses and transactions by integrating accounting software such as Intuit Quickbooks, FreshBooks, or Brex. You can also import a custom CSV. \n3. HRMS (Human Resource Management System)\nConnecting your HRMS will let Zluri track employee data like departments, designations, reporting managers, and joining dates. Zluri supports popular HRMS like BambooHR, Personio, and Keka.\nOther recommended integrations\nHaving set the foundations, add other integrations by exploring the Integrations Catalog. See our curated list of essential integrations and staff picks for starters.\n\ud83d\udcdc Set primary sources\nWith the key integrations in place, you might find that multiple apps might contain the same information. .\nFor example, both Google Workspace and BambooHR might provide employees' designations and profile pictures, but you want the latter to be the source of truth for these.\nTo remedy this, Zluri lets you choose different sources for individual fields.
